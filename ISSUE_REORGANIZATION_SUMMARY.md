# Issue Reorganization Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-11  
**Task:** Move resolved issues to folder and identify next implementation phase

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Moved Completed Issues to `resolved/` Folder

**31 completed tasks** (25 newly moved + 6 already in resolved from Group 1) have been moved from active development directories to the resolved folder to maintain focus on remaining work.

#### Phase 3 Implementation Groups Moved:
- ✅ **Group 2: Idea Generation** (7 tasks) → `issues/resolved/phase-3-implementation/group-2-idea-generation/`
- ✅ **Group 4: Scene Planning** (3 tasks) → `issues/resolved/phase-3-implementation/group-4-scene-planning/`
- ✅ **Group 6: Subtitle Creation** (2 tasks) → `issues/resolved/phase-3-implementation/group-6-subtitle-creation/`
- ✅ **Group 7: Image Generation** (4 tasks) → `issues/resolved/phase-3-implementation/group-7-image-generation/`
- ✅ **Group 8: Video Production** (2 of 3 tasks) → `issues/resolved/phase-3-implementation/group-8-video-production/`
- ✅ **Group 9: Post-Production** (6 tasks) → `issues/resolved/phase-3-implementation/group-9-post-production/`

#### Phase 4 Orchestration Moved:
- ✅ **Pipeline Orchestration** (1 task) → `issues/resolved/phase-4-pipeline-orchestration/`

### 2. Updated Documentation

#### Created New Documentation:
- `issues/resolved/phase-3-implementation/README.md` - Complete overview of resolved Phase 3 tasks
- `issues/resolved/phase-4-pipeline-orchestration/README.md` - Phase 4 completion summary

#### Updated Existing Documentation:
- `issues/resolved/README.md` - Added Phase 3 and Phase 4 sections (now 46+ tasks)
- `issues/p1-high/README.md` - Updated to show remaining work (~14 tasks, ~68% complete)
- `issues/README.md` - Updated progress tracking and directory structure
- `NEXT_PHASE3_TASKS.md` - Corrected status and priorities

### 3. Cleaned Up Active Directories

**Removed empty directories from `p1-high/`:**
- `idea-generation/` (all tasks moved to resolved)
- `scene-planning/` (all tasks moved to resolved)
- `subtitle-creation/` (all tasks moved to resolved)
- `image-generation/` (all tasks moved to resolved)
- `post-production/` (all tasks moved to resolved)
- `csharp-phase4-pipeline-orchestration/` (moved to resolved)

### 4. Identified Next Implementation Phase

**Group 3: Script Development** - Lowest numbered incomplete group

---

## Current Status

### Progress Summary
- **Total P1-P2 Tasks:** 78 tasks (estimated)
- **Completed (in resolved/):** 46 tasks (59%)
- **Remaining (in p1-high + p2):** 32 tasks (41%)

**Note:** The p1-high folder specifically is ~68% complete (30 of 44 P1 tasks done), while overall project completion including P2 tasks is ~59%.

### Phase 3 Implementation Progress
- **Total Groups:** 13
- **Completed:** 7 groups (54%)
  - Group 1: Content Pipeline ✅ (in resolved/p0-content-pipeline/)
  - Group 2: Idea Generation ✅
  - Group 4: Scene Planning ✅
  - Group 6: Subtitle Creation ✅
  - Group 7: Image Generation ✅
  - Group 8: Video Production ⚠️ (2 of 3 tasks)
  - Group 9: Post-Production ✅

- **Remaining:** 6 groups (46%)
  - Group 3: Script Development ❌ (5 tasks) **← NEXT PRIORITY**
  - Group 5: Audio Production ❌ (2 tasks)
  - Group 8: Video Production ⚠️ (1 task - variant selection)
  - Group 10: Quality Control ❌ (3 tasks)
  - Group 11: Export & Delivery ❌ (3 tasks)
  - Group 12: Distribution ❌ (P2 - 4 tasks)

### Phase 4 Status
- ✅ **Complete** - Pipeline Orchestration (moved to resolved)

## Next Steps: Group 3 - Script Development

**Priority:** P1 (CRITICAL)  
**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Tasks:** 5 tasks  
**Estimated Effort:** 15-20 hours  
**Location:** `issues/p1-high/script-development/`

### Why This is Next:
1. **Lowest numbered incomplete group** (Group 3)
2. Groups 1 and 2 are complete
3. Required for end-to-end pipeline
4. Blocks downstream groups (audio, video, etc.)

### Tasks in Group 3:
1. `05-script-01-raw-generation` - Generate initial video script
2. `05-script-02-script-scorer` - Score script quality
3. `05-script-03-iteration` - Iteratively improve scripts
4. `05-script-04-gpt-improvement` - GPT-based enhancement
5. `05-script-05-title-improvement` - Optimize video title

### Implementation Path:
```bash
cd issues/p1-high/script-development/
# Review each task's issue.md file
# Implement following TDD practices
# Test and document as you go
```

## Remaining P1 Tasks After Group 3

### Priority Order:
1. **Group 5: Audio Production** (2 tasks) - Critical for video synthesis
2. **Group 8: Video variant selection** (1 task) - Quality improvement
3. **Group 10: Quality Control** (3 tasks) - Pre-delivery validation
4. **Group 11: Export & Delivery** (3 tasks) - Final encoding and metadata

**Total remaining after Group 3:** ~9 tasks (~25-40 hours)
