# Resolved Issues

This directory contains completed issues that have been resolved and no longer require active development.

## Overview

Issues are moved here when they reach "✅ Complete" status. This helps keep the active issues directory focused on current and future work while preserving the history and documentation of completed work.

## Organization

## Best Practices

### When to Move Issues Here

An issue should be moved to `resolved/` when:
1. **Status is "✅ Complete"** - All acceptance criteria met
2. **Code is merged** - Changes are integrated into the main codebase
3. **Tests pass** - All tests are passing (following TDD practices)
4. **Documentation updated** - Related documentation reflects the changes
5. **Peer reviewed** - Changes have been reviewed and approved

### Maintenance

- Resolved issues are kept for historical reference and documentation
- They should not be modified unless correcting significant errors
- Use them as examples and references for similar future work
