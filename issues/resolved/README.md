# Resolved Issues

This directory contains completed issues that have been resolved and no longer require active development.

## Overview

Issues are moved here when they reach "✅ Complete" status. This helps keep the active issues directory focused on current and future work while preserving the history and documentation of completed work.

## Organization

Resolved issues are organized by phase to maintain the original structure:

### Phase 1: Interface (✅ All Complete)
**Location:** `phase-1-interface/`

Setup and configuration tasks that defined the project structure:
- **00-setup-01-repo-structure** - Repository folder structure
- **00-setup-02-config-files** - Configuration file schemas
- **00-setup-04-csharp-projects** - C# project structure and dependencies

### Phase 2: Prototype (✅ All Complete)
**Location:** `phase-2-prototype/`

Research and validation of C# integrations:
- **01-research-06-csharp-ollama** - C# Ollama LLM client
- **01-research-07-csharp-whisper** - C# Whisper ASR client
- **01-research-08-csharp-ffmpeg** - C# FFmpeg media processing

## Status

- **Phase 1:** 3/3 tasks complete (100%)
- **Phase 2:** 3/3 tasks complete (100%)
- **Total Resolved:** 6 tasks

## Best Practices

### When to Move Issues Here

An issue should be moved to `resolved/` when:
1. **Status is "✅ Complete"** - All acceptance criteria met
2. **Code is merged** - Changes are integrated into the main codebase
3. **Tests pass** - All tests are passing (following TDD practices)
4. **Documentation updated** - Related documentation reflects the changes
5. **Peer reviewed** - Changes have been reviewed and approved

### Maintenance

- Resolved issues are kept for historical reference and documentation
- They should not be modified unless correcting significant errors
- Use them as examples and references for similar future work

## Active Issues

- **Critical Priority (P0):** `/issues/p0-critical/`
- **High Priority (P1):** `/issues/p1-high/`
- **Medium Priority (P2):** `/issues/p2-medium/`
- **Master Roadmap:** `/issues/csharp-master-roadmap/`
