# P0 Security Issues - RESOLVED ✅

**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Status:** ✅ ALL COMPLETE  
**Date Completed:** 2025-01-11

## Overview

Critical security issues that were identified and resolved. Both issues addressed potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase.

## Completed Issues

### security-api-keys ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Effort:** 2-4 hours  
**Severity:** CRITICAL

**Description:** Remove exposed API keys from source code. All hardcoded API keys have been removed and replaced with environment variable management.

**Completed:**
- [x] Removed hardcoded API keys from 7 obsolete Python files
- [x] Implemented environment variable management with python-dotenv
- [x] All code now reads API keys from .env file
- [x] Repository verified for remaining secrets - none found

**User Action Required:**
- ⚠️ Revoke exposed API keys from OpenAI and ElevenLabs dashboards
- ⚠️ Generate new API keys and add to local .env file

### security-file-paths ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE (Already Resolved)  
**Effort:** 0 hours (Previously completed)  
**Severity:** HIGH

**Description:** Fix hard-coded Windows-specific file paths. Verification shows all paths already use platform-independent path handling.

**Verified:**
- [x] No hardcoded absolute paths in codebase
- [x] All paths use os.path.join() for platform independence
- [x] Paths are relative to dynamically-calculated PROJECT_ROOT
- [x] Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Impact

Both security issues were critical blockers that needed immediate attention:
- **API Key Security:** Prevented potential unauthorized access to paid API services
- **Path Portability:** Ensured code works across all platforms without modification

## Next Steps

Security foundation is now solid. Continue with:
- Regular security audits
- Environment variable best practices
- Platform testing for new features
