# Group 1 ‚Äî Progress & Coordination Hub

This issue tracks all unfinished tasks, current priorities, and blockers for **Group 1** development in StoryGenerator. Maintainers should update this issue with:
- The current priority from `issues/group_1/.NEXT.MD`
- Unfinished tasks from `issues/group_1/.ISSUES/`
- Blockers, risks, and links to roadmaps or child issues

---

## üìÖ Update Checklist
- [x] `.NEXT.MD` is up to date
- [x] Unfinished tasks listed below
- [x] Blockers/risks noted
- [x] Roadmap synced

## Current Focus (`.NEXT.MD`)

**Phase:** Foundation & Infrastructure Enhancement
**Status:** üìã Ready to start - 9 tasks available (37-55 hours)

### Recently Completed (October 9, 2025)
‚úÖ **Basic Infrastructure** - Testing, configuration, and logging foundation (C# implementation)
- See: [INFRASTRUCTURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md](docs/implementation/csharp/INFRASTRUCTURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

### Available Work
Group 1 now focuses on **enhanced foundation work**:
- 3 Infrastructure tasks (13-19h)
- 2 Architecture tasks (10-14h)
- 3 Code Quality tasks (9-15h)
- 1 Performance task (5-7h)

**Next Recommended:** `infrastructure-testing` (6-8h) or `infrastructure-configuration` (4-6h)

## Unfinished Tasks

### üì¶ Infrastructure Foundation (13-19h)

1. **Testing Infrastructure** ([infrastructure-testing.md](issues/group_1/.ISSUES/infrastructure-testing.md)) - 6-8h - P1
   - Set up comprehensive testing framework with pytest, fixtures, mocks, coverage reporting
   - CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
   - Mock providers for testing without API keys

2. **Configuration Management** ([infrastructure-configuration.md](issues/group_1/.ISSUES/infrastructure-configuration.md)) - 4-6h - P1
   - Centralized configuration using environment variables and config files
   - Type-safe configuration access using Pydantic
   - Different configs for dev/prod environments

3. **Logging System** ([infrastructure-logging.md](issues/group_1/.ISSUES/infrastructure-logging.md)) - 3-5h - P1
   - Structured logging with console and file handlers
   - JSON format for production, request ID tracking
   - Context manager for contextual logging

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements (10-14h)

4. **Component Decoupling** ([architecture-decoupling.md](issues/group_1/.ISSUES/architecture-decoupling.md)) - 6-8h - P1
   - Refactor tightly coupled components into modular units
   - Implement dependency injection and clear interfaces
   - Remove circular dependencies

5. **OpenAI API Patterns** ([architecture-openai-api.md](issues/group_1/.ISSUES/architecture-openai-api.md)) - 4-6h - P1
   - Standardize OpenAI API interaction patterns
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Token counting and cost tracking

### ‚úÖ Code Quality Enhancements (9-15h)

6. **Code Style Standards** ([code-quality-code-style.md](issues/group_1/.ISSUES/code-quality-code-style.md)) - 2-4h - P1
   - Black code formatter and Flake8 linting
   - Pre-commit hooks for automated checking
   - Codebase formatting according to standards

7. **Error Handling Patterns** ([code-quality-error-handling.md](issues/group_1/.ISSUES/code-quality-error-handling.md)) - 4-6h - P1
   - Custom exception hierarchy
   - Error handling decorators and graceful degradation
   - Error logging and reporting

8. **Input Validation** ([code-quality-input-validation.md](issues/group_1/.ISSUES/code-quality-input-validation.md)) - 3-5h - P1
   - Pydantic models for data validation
   - Validation decorators for functions
   - Type hints throughout codebase

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization (5-7h)

9. **Caching Layer** ([performance-caching.md](issues/group_1/.ISSUES/performance-caching.md)) - 5-7h - P1
   - Caching for expensive operations (LLM calls, image generation)
   - Redis or file-based cache backend with TTL
   - Cache hit/miss metrics and invalidation strategies

---

## Blockers/Risks

### Current Blockers
**None** - All tasks are independent and ready to start

### Potential Risks

üü° **Medium Risk:**
- **Refactoring Impact:** Architecture decoupling may require updates across multiple modules
  - *Mitigation:* Incremental refactoring with comprehensive tests
- **Testing Coordination:** Testing infrastructure needs CI/CD coordination
  - *Mitigation:* Define standards early, integrate gradually
- **Cache Backend Decision:** Choice between Redis vs file-based caching
  - *Mitigation:* Start with file-based (simpler), Redis as optional upgrade

üü¢ **Low Risk:**
- **Code Style Enforcement:** Initial formatting may generate large diffs
  - *Mitigation:* Apply in dedicated commit, use .git-blame-ignore-revs
- **Configuration Migration:** Existing configs may need migration
  - *Mitigation:* Support both old and new formats during transition

## Execution Strategy

### Recommended Order
1. **Phase 1 (Infrastructure):** testing ‚Üí configuration ‚Üí logging
2. **Phase 2 (Architecture):** decoupling ‚Üí openai-api
3. **Phase 3 (Code Quality):** input-validation ‚Üí error-handling ‚Üí code-style
4. **Phase 4 (Performance):** caching

### Parallelization
Tasks within each phase can be worked in parallel by different team members.

### Timeline
- **With 1 developer:** 4-6 weeks sequential
- **With 2-3 developers:** 2-3 weeks with parallel work
