# Group 1 - Current Focus

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10
**Status:** 📋 Ready to start - Foundation tasks available

---

## 🎯 Current Priority

**Phase:** Foundation & Infrastructure
**Total Unfinished Tasks:** 3 issues (12-22 hours estimated)
**Next Recommended Task:** architecture-openai-api (4-6h)
**Recently Completed:** 
- code-quality-error-handling (Oct 10, 2025)
- code-quality-input-validation (Oct 10, 2025)
- code-quality-code-style (Oct 10, 2025)
- infrastructure-testing (Oct 10, 2025)
- infrastructure-logging (Oct 10, 2025)
- infrastructure-configuration (Oct 10, 2025)

### Recently Completed (October 9, 2025)
✅ **Basic Infrastructure** - Testing, configuration, and logging foundation (C# implementation)
- See: [INFRASTRUCTURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md](../../docs/implementation/csharp/INFRASTRUCTURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

### Current Stage
Group 1 now focuses on **enhanced foundation work** including:
- Architecture improvements (decoupling, OpenAI API patterns)
- Code quality enhancements (style, error handling, validation)
- Additional infrastructure (testing frameworks, logging enhancements)
- Performance optimization (caching layer)

**Independence:** ✅ Highly independent - provides foundational services used by all groups without depending on pipeline content

## 🎯 Next Priority Task

**Task:** architecture-openai-api  
**File:** [architecture-openai-api.md](.ISSUES/architecture-openai-api.md)  
**Effort:** 4-6 hours  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Description:** Optimize OpenAI API usage with rate limiting, token counting, cost tracking, and efficient batching/caching strategies.

**Why this task next:**
- Can leverage error handling (just completed)
- Critical for cost control and API optimization
- Enables efficient API usage across pipeline
- Required before heavy API usage in pipeline stages
- Medium effort (4-6h) suitable for one work session
- Can be worked in parallel with architecture-decoupling

**Dependencies Met:**
- ✅ code-quality-error-handling (completed) - provides retry logic
- ✅ infrastructure-logging (completed) - for usage monitoring

## 📋 Recommended Execution Order

**Start with Infrastructure (foundational):**
1. infrastructure-testing → infrastructure-configuration → infrastructure-logging

**Then Architecture (enables better design):**
2. architecture-decoupling → architecture-openai-api

**Follow with Code Quality (improves robustness):**
3. code-quality-input-validation → code-quality-error-handling → code-quality-code-style

**Finally Performance (optimization):**
4. performance-caching

**Parallelization:** Tasks within each category can be worked in parallel by different team members.

## 🚧 Blockers / Risks

**Current Blockers:** None - all tasks are independent and ready to start

**Potential Risks:**
- Refactoring work (architecture-decoupling) may require updates to existing code
- Testing infrastructure may need coordination with CI/CD setup
- Caching implementation requires decision on Redis vs file-based approach
