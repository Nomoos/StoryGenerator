# Group 1 - Current Focus

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10
**Status:** 📋 Ready to start - Foundation tasks available

---

## 🎯 Current Priority

**Phase:** Foundation & Infrastructure
**Total Unfinished Tasks:** 7 issues (29-44 hours estimated)
**Next Recommended Task:** infrastructure-testing (6-8h)
**Recently Completed:** 
- infrastructure-logging (Oct 10, 2025)
- infrastructure-configuration (Oct 10, 2025)

### Recently Completed (October 9, 2025)
✅ **Basic Infrastructure** - Testing, configuration, and logging foundation (C# implementation)
- See: [INFRASTRUCTURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md](../../docs/implementation/csharp/INFRASTRUCTURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

### Current Stage
Group 1 now focuses on **enhanced foundation work** including:
- Architecture improvements (decoupling, OpenAI API patterns)
- Code quality enhancements (style, error handling, validation)
- Additional infrastructure (testing frameworks, logging enhancements)
- Performance optimization (caching layer)

**Independence:** ✅ Highly independent - provides foundational services used by all groups without depending on pipeline content

## 📊 Unfinished Tasks Summary

### Infrastructure (1 task remaining, 6-8h)
1. **infrastructure-testing** - Testing framework setup (6-8h) - P1
2. ~~**infrastructure-configuration** - Configuration management (4-6h) - P1~~ ✅ **COMPLETE**
3. ~~**infrastructure-logging** - Enhanced logging system (3-5h) - P1~~ ✅ **COMPLETE**

### Architecture (2 tasks, 10-14h)
4. **architecture-decoupling** - Component decoupling (6-8h) - P1
5. **architecture-openai-api** - OpenAI API patterns (4-6h) - P1

### Code Quality (3 tasks, 9-15h)
6. **code-quality-code-style** - Code style standards (2-4h) - P1
7. **code-quality-error-handling** - Error handling patterns (4-6h) - P1
8. **code-quality-input-validation** - Input validation (3-5h) - P1

### Performance (1 task, 5-7h)
9. **performance-caching** - Caching & optimization (5-7h) - P1

**Total Effort:** 29-44 hours across 7 remaining tasks

## 🎯 Next Priority Task

**Task:** infrastructure-testing  
**File:** [infrastructure-testing.md](.ISSUES/infrastructure-testing.md)  
**Effort:** 6-8 hours  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Description:** Set up comprehensive testing framework with pytest, fixtures, mocks, and coverage reporting. Integrate with CI/CD.

**Why this task next:**
- Testing framework is foundational for all future development
- Enables TDD practices for remaining tasks
- Validates infrastructure components already built (config, logging)
- Required for code quality tasks later in the pipeline

## 📋 Recommended Execution Order

**Start with Infrastructure (foundational):**
1. infrastructure-testing → infrastructure-configuration → infrastructure-logging

**Then Architecture (enables better design):**
2. architecture-decoupling → architecture-openai-api

**Follow with Code Quality (improves robustness):**
3. code-quality-input-validation → code-quality-error-handling → code-quality-code-style

**Finally Performance (optimization):**
4. performance-caching

**Parallelization:** Tasks within each category can be worked in parallel by different team members.

## 🚧 Blockers / Risks

**Current Blockers:** None - all tasks are independent and ready to start

**Potential Risks:**
- Refactoring work (architecture-decoupling) may require updates to existing code
- Testing infrastructure may need coordination with CI/CD setup
- Caching implementation requires decision on Redis vs file-based approach
