# Infrastructure: Comprehensive Testing Framework

**Group:** group_1  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Not Started  
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours  

## Description

Set up comprehensive testing framework with unit tests, integration tests, and test coverage reporting. Establish testing standards and CI/CD integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] pytest configuration with fixtures and markers
- [ ] Unit test coverage >80% for core modules
- [ ] Integration tests for API providers
- [ ] Mock providers for testing without API keys
- [ ] Test coverage reporting (pytest-cov)
- [ ] CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Testing documentation and guidelines

## Dependencies

- Install: `pytest>=7.0.0 pytest-cov>=4.0.0 pytest-mock>=3.10.0`
- No blocking dependencies (can work in parallel)

## Implementation Notes

Create `pytest.ini`:

```ini
[pytest]
testpaths = tests
python_files = test_*.py
python_classes = Test*
python_functions = test_*
addopts = 
    --cov=core
    --cov=providers
    --cov-report=html
    --cov-report=term-missing
    -v
markers =
    unit: Unit tests
    integration: Integration tests  
    slow: Slow running tests
```

Create mock providers in `tests/mocks/`:
- `mock_openai_provider.py`
- `mock_elevenlabs_provider.py`
