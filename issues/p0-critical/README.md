## Best Practices

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. **Write tests first** - Define expected behavior before implementation
2. **Red-Green-Refactor** - Write failing test → Make it pass → Improve code
3. **Unit test coverage** - Target >80% coverage for critical components
4. **Integration tests** - Verify component interactions
5. **Continuous testing** - Run tests on every code change

### Development Workflow
1. Review acceptance criteria thoroughly
2. Write comprehensive unit tests
3. Implement minimal code to pass tests
4. Refactor and optimize
5. Document API and usage
6. Peer review before merging

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow SOLID principles
- Use dependency injection
- Implement proper error handling
- Add XML documentation comments
- Follow C# coding conventions
- Use async/await patterns appropriately

## Dependencies
