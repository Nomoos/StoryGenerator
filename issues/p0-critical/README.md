# P0 - Critical Priority Issues

**Priority Level:** P0 (Critical)  
**Status:** Active Development  
**Focus:** Immediate implementation required

## Overview

This folder contains critical priority issues that must be completed immediately. These tasks are blockers for other work and represent the highest priority items for the project.

## Current Issues

### C# Implementation

#### csharp-phase3-complete-generators
**Status:** Not Started  
**Effort:** 16-24 hours  
**Description:** Complete the remaining generators in the C# implementation to achieve full feature parity with the obsolete Python implementation.

**Blocks:**
- Phase 4: Pipeline Orchestration
- Python code removal

### Content Pipeline

#### content-pipeline/
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** P0/P1 (Critical Path)  
**Description:** Core content sourcing and quality control pipeline

**Key Tasks:**
- **02-content-01-reddit-scraper** (P0 Critical Path) - Reddit story scraping
- **02-content-02-alt-sources** (P1) - Alternative content sources
- **02-content-03-quality-scorer** (P1) - Content quality assessment
- **02-content-04-deduplication** (P1) - Duplicate content detection
- **02-content-05-ranking** (P1) - Content ranking system
- **02-content-06-attribution** (P1) - Source attribution tracking

## Best Practices

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. **Write tests first** - Define expected behavior before implementation
2. **Red-Green-Refactor** - Write failing test → Make it pass → Improve code
3. **Unit test coverage** - Target >80% coverage for critical components
4. **Integration tests** - Verify component interactions
5. **Continuous testing** - Run tests on every code change

### Development Workflow
1. Review acceptance criteria thoroughly
2. Write comprehensive unit tests
3. Implement minimal code to pass tests
4. Refactor and optimize
5. Document API and usage
6. Peer review before merging

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow SOLID principles
- Use dependency injection
- Implement proper error handling
- Add XML documentation comments
- Follow C# coding conventions
- Use async/await patterns appropriately

## Dependencies

**Completed:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Interface (All tasks complete)
- ✅ Phase 2: Prototype (All tasks complete)

**Blocks:**
- Phase 4: Pipeline Orchestration
- Video generation workflows
- Full end-to-end pipeline

## Getting Started

1. Review the issue details in each subdirectory
2. Check dependencies and prerequisites
3. Write tests for acceptance criteria
4. Implement following TDD practices
5. Document as you code
6. Submit for peer review

**Total P0 Issues:** 2 major tasks + 6 content pipeline tasks  
**Estimated Effort:** 20-30 hours  
**Next Priority:** Move to P1-High after P0 completion
