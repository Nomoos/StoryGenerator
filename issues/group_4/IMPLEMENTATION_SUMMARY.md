## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
1. **Task 1:** None - Ready to start (waiting for Group 3 video production)
2. **Task 2:** Blocked by Task 1 completion
3. **Task 3:** Blocked by Task 1 & 2 completion

### Identified Risks
1. Video production dependency on Group 3
2. API credentials required for distribution platforms
3. Multiple Python package dependencies
4. Potential platform API changes
5. QC threshold tuning may be needed

### Mitigation Strategies
- Coordinate with Group 3 on timeline
- Set up API credentials early
- Install and test packages before implementation
- Build flexible configuration
- Use well-maintained API libraries

## Timeline

**Total Estimated Effort:** 19-24 hours over 7 working days

**Week 1:**
- Days 1-2: Task 1 - Video Variant Selection (3-4h)
- Days 2-4: Task 2 - Quality Control System (6-8h)

**Week 2:**
- Days 5-7: Task 3 - Multi-Platform Distribution (10-12h)

## Documentation Structure

All documentation follows the MainProgressHub pattern:

1. **`.NEXT.MD`** - Current single focus item
2. **`.ISSUES/`** - Unfinished tasks (3 files)
3. **`.DONE/`** - Completed tasks (empty)
4. **`README.md`** - Group overview
5. **`GROUP_4_TRACKING.md`** - Comprehensive tracking
6. **`ISSUE_UPDATE.md`** - Issue update template

## Success Criteria

Group 4 will be complete when:
- ✅ All 3 tasks completed and tested
- ✅ Automated variant selection working
- ✅ Quality assurance validating all videos
- ✅ Multi-platform publishing functional
- ✅ End-to-end workflow validated
- ✅ All issues moved to `.DONE/`
- ✅ Roadmap updated
- ✅ Documentation complete

## Related Work

This coordination hub builds upon completed work in:
- Group 8: Video Production (LTX-Video, interpolation)
- Group 9: Post-Production (effects, transitions)
- Group 10: Quality Control (preview, sync check)
- Group 11: Export & Delivery (encoding, metadata)

## Next Steps

1. **Start Task 1:** Begin Video Variant Selection implementation
2. **Coordinate with Group 3:** Confirm video production timeline
3. **Set up environment:** Install required Python packages
4. **Monitor progress:** Update `.NEXT.MD` as work progresses
5. **Update tracking:** Move completed tasks to `.DONE/`
