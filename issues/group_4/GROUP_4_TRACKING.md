# Group 4: Assembly/Distribution - Task Tracking

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10  
**Status:** ðŸ”„ In Progress  
**Total Estimated Effort:** 19-24 hours  
**Completed:** 2 of 3 tasks (67%)  
**Remaining:** 10-12 hours

---

## ðŸ“Š Overview

Group 4 handles the final stage of the video production pipeline: video variant selection, quality control validation, and multi-platform distribution. This is the **terminal stage** of the pipeline, consuming assets from Group 3 and delivering final published videos.

**Current Focus:** Multi-Platform Distribution (Task 3 of 3)

**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Status:** âœ… Complete  
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours

### Description
Implement automated quality control system that validates videos against quality standards, checks for common issues, and generates QC reports before distribution.

### Key Features
- Audio-video sync validation
- Visual quality checks (resolution, bitrate, artifacts)
- Audio quality checks (volume, clipping, silence)
- Subtitle validation (timing, readability)
- Duration and aspect ratio verification
- Pass/fail decision with remediation suggestions

### Dependencies
- **Requires:** Selected video variants from Task 1 (âœ… Complete)
- **Blocks:** Distribution (Task 3)
- **Packages:** `ffmpeg-python>=0.2.0`, `opencv-python>=4.8.0`

### Output
- QC reports for each video
- Pass/fail status
- Location: `data/qc_reports/{gender}/{age_bucket}/`

## ðŸŽ¯ Task 3: Distribution - Multi-Platform Publisher

**File:** [.ISSUES/distribution-multi-platform.md](.ISSUES/distribution-multi-platform.md)  
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)  
**Status:** ðŸ”„ In Progress (Current Priority)  
**Estimated Effort:** 10-12 hours

### Description
Implement multi-platform video publishing system that automates upload to YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook with platform-specific optimization.

### Key Features
- YouTube upload with API integration
- TikTok upload with API integration
- Instagram Reels upload
- Facebook video upload
- Platform-specific optimization
- Metadata and thumbnail upload
- Upload scheduling and queue management
- Error handling and retry logic

### Dependencies
- **Requires:** QC-passed videos from Task 2
- **Requires:** API credentials for each platform
- **Packages:** `google-api-python-client>=2.0.0`, `instagrapi>=1.16.0`

### Output
- Upload results for all platforms
- Upload tracking logs
- Location: `data/distribution/{date}/`

## ðŸš§ Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- **Task 1:** âœ… Complete - Moved to `.DONE/`
- **Task 2:** âœ… Complete - Moved to `.DONE/`
- **Task 3:** None - Ready to start (requires API credentials)

### Potential Risks
1. **Video Production Dependency:** Tasks depend on Group 3 completing video production
2. **API Credentials:** Task 3 requires platform API credentials (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook)
3. **Package Dependencies:** Multiple Python packages needed across tasks
4. **Platform API Changes:** Social media APIs may change, requiring updates
5. **Quality Standards:** QC thresholds may need tuning based on actual video quality

### Mitigation Strategies
- Coordinate with Group 3 for video production timeline
- Set up platform API credentials early
- Install and test required packages before implementation
- Build flexible configuration for QC thresholds
- Use latest API client libraries with good maintenance
