## ðŸŽ¯ Current Priority

**Task:** Video Production: Variant Selection  
**Issue File:** [.ISSUES/10-video-03-variant-selection.md](.ISSUES/10-video-03-variant-selection.md)  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours  
**Started:** 2025-10-10

### Description

Implement video variant selection system that analyzes generated videos and selects the best variant based on quality metrics, visual coherence, and motion smoothness. This is the first step in the Assembly/Distribution pipeline as we need selected videos before QC and publishing.

### Progress

- [ ] Video quality scoring algorithm implemented
- [ ] Variant comparison and selection logic
- [ ] Quality metrics calculation (sharpness, stability, coherence)
- [ ] Metadata tracking for each variant
- [ ] Selected variant output with justification
- [ ] Unit tests for selection logic

### Dependencies

- Requires: Video production output from Group 3 (video interpolation)
- Blocks: Quality Control and Distribution tasks
- Python packages: `opencv-python>=4.8.0`, `scikit-image>=0.21.0`

### Next Up

After completing variant selection:
1. **Quality Control** - Automated Video QC System (6-8h)
2. **Distribution** - Multi-Platform Publisher (10-12h)

Total estimated effort for all 3 tasks: **19-24 hours**
