# Phase 1: Interface Definition

**Purpose:** Define interfaces, contracts, configurations, and project structure before implementation.

**Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Team Size:** 2-4 developers  
**Priority:** P0 - Critical Path

## Overview

This phase establishes the foundational structure and contracts that all subsequent phases depend on. Think of it as defining the "what" before the "how".

## Phase Objectives

- Set up repository folder structure
- Define configuration files and schemas
- Configure development environments (Python & C#)
- Establish project structure and dependencies

## Tasks in This Phase

### Setup Tasks (4 tasks)

1. **00-setup-01-repo-structure** - Repository folder structure
2. **00-setup-02-config-files** - YAML configuration files
3. **00-setup-03-python-env** - Python environment setup
4. **00-setup-04-csharp-projects** - C# project structure

## Execution Strategy

**Sequential vs Parallel:**
- Tasks 01 and 02 should complete first (can run in parallel)
- Tasks 03 and 04 depend on 01 and 02 (can run in parallel after)

**Recommended Approach:**
```
Day 1:
├── Dev 1-2: Repo structure + Config files (parallel)
└── After completion:
    ├── Dev 3: Python environment
    └── Dev 4: C# projects
```

## Dependencies

**This Phase Requires:**
- None (starting point)

**This Phase Blocks:**
- Phase 2: Prototype (all research tasks need the structure)
- Phase 3: Implementation (all content pipeline tasks need configs)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All folder structures exist and follow conventions
- [ ] Configuration files are valid and documented
- [ ] Python environment can be activated
- [ ] C# projects build successfully
- [ ] All schemas are defined and validated

## Next Steps

After completing this phase:
1. Move to **Phase 2: Prototype** for research and POC work
2. Multiple developers can work on different research prototypes in parallel
