# Atomic Issues - Phase-Based Organization

This directory contains **58 atomic, independently executable issues** organized into **3 phases**: Interface → Prototype → Implementation.

## 🎯 Phase-Based Approach

### Why Phases?

The pipeline follows a natural progression:
1. **Interface** - Define the "what" (configs, schemas, structure)
2. **Prototype** - Validate the "how" (research, POC, integration patterns)
3. **Implementation** - Build the "real thing" (production pipeline)

This approach ensures:
- ✅ Clear dependencies and blockers
- ✅ Reduced rework (validate before building)
- ✅ Better team coordination
- ✅ Incremental value delivery

## 📋 Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Interface (3 tasks, 1-2 days)
**👉 [View Phase 1 Details](phase-1-interface/README.md)**

Define the foundational structure before any implementation:
- Repository folder structure
- Configuration files (YAML schemas)
- C# project structure

**Priority:** P0 - Critical Path  
**Team Size:** 2-3 developers

---

### Phase 2: Prototype (3 tasks, 1-2 days)
**👉 [View Phase 2 Details](phase-2-prototype/README.md)**

Build proof-of-concept C# implementations for integrations:
- C# clients: Ollama, Whisper, FFmpeg

**Priority:** P0 - Critical Path  
**Team Size:** 3 developers  
**Parallelization:** High - all 3 tasks can run simultaneously

---

### Phase 3: Implementation (52 tasks, 8-12 days)
**👉 [View Phase 3 Details](phase-3-implementation/README.md)**

Build the complete production pipeline across 13 logical groups:

#### 3.1 Content Pipeline (6 tasks, 2-3 days)
Source and process raw content for video ideas.
**[View Group →](phase-3-implementation/content-pipeline/README.md)**

## 🚀 Execution Strategy

### Sequential Phase Approach
Execute phases in order to minimize risk:

```
Week 1:
├── Days 1-2: Phase 1 (Interface)
└── Days 3-5: Phase 2 (Prototype)

Week 2-3:
└── Days 6-17: Phase 3 (Implementation)
    ├── Wave 1: Content Pipeline + Idea Generation
    ├── Wave 2: Script through Subtitle Creation
    ├── Wave 3: Image through Post-Production
    └── Wave 4: QC through Analytics
```

### Parallel Execution Within Phases

**Phase 1:** Limited parallelism (3 tasks, dependencies)  
**Phase 2:** High parallelism (3 tasks, minimal dependencies)  
**Phase 3:** Very high parallelism (13 groups, 52 tasks)

### Team Size Recommendations

- **Small Team (5 devs):** Sequential phases, limited parallel groups
- **Medium Team (10 devs):** Parallel phases 1-2, 3-4 groups in Phase 3
- **Large Team (20 devs):** Full parallelization across all phases

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### By Phase
- [x] Phase 1: Interface (3 tasks) ✅

## 📚 Key Documentation

- **This File:** Overall phase organization
- **Phase README files:** Detailed phase execution guides
- **Group README files:** Specific task group details
- **Individual issue.md:** Granular task requirements

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **Start with Phase 1:** Don't skip ahead - foundational work is critical
2. **Complete Phase 2 fully:** Prototypes save time in Phase 3
3. **Use feature branches:** `feature/phase-{1,2,3}-{task-id}`
4. **Daily standups:** Coordinate within phases and groups
5. **MicrostepValidator:** Track granular progress per task

## 🔄 Migration from Old Structure

If you were using the old flat structure:
- Old task IDs remain the same
- Tasks now organized by phase and group
- All issue.md files preserved without changes
- Update your documentation references to new paths
