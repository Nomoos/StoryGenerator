# Phase 2: Prototype & Research

**Purpose:** Build proof-of-concept implementations and validate technical approaches.

**Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Team Size:** 3 developers  
**Priority:** P0 - Critical Path

## Overview

This phase creates research prototypes to validate integration patterns with external services and tools. These are minimal, working implementations that prove feasibility before full production code.

## Phase Objectives

- Build working C# prototypes for external service integrations
- Validate API patterns and data flows for C# implementations
- Test integration with local models (Ollama, Whisper) and tools (FFmpeg)
- Establish best practices for C# implementations

## Tasks in This Phase

### C# Research (3 tasks)
1. **01-research-06-csharp-ollama** - C# Ollama integration
2. **01-research-07-csharp-whisper** - C# Whisper integration
3. **01-research-08-csharp-ffmpeg** - C# FFmpeg wrapper

## Execution Strategy

**Parallelization:**
All 3 tasks can run simultaneously with minimal dependencies.

**Recommended Approach:**
```
Day 1-2: Parallel execution
├── Dev 1: C# Ollama
├── Dev 2: C# Whisper
└── Dev 3: C# FFmpeg
```

## Dependencies

**This Phase Requires:**
- Phase 1: Interface (config files, environment setup)

**This Phase Blocks:**
- Phase 3: Implementation (content pipeline needs working integrations)

## Success Criteria

- [x] All C# prototypes successfully integrate with external tools
- [x] Performance benchmarks documented for each service
- [x] API patterns established and documented
- [x] Known limitations and gotchas documented

## Key Deliverables

Each prototype should include:
- Working code with minimal dependencies
- Example usage/test code
- Performance notes (speed, memory, GPU usage)
- Integration patterns for production use
- Troubleshooting guide

## Research Focus Areas

### Ollama Integration (C#)
- Token streaming vs batch
- Context window management
- Prompt engineering best practices
- C# async/await patterns

### Whisper ASR (C#)
- Word-level timestamp accuracy
- Language detection
- Forced alignment techniques
- P/Invoke or managed library integration

### FFmpeg (C#)
- 9:16 aspect ratio cropping
- LUFS normalization to -14
- Codec selection (H.264 vs H.265)
- Process management and error handling

## Next Steps

After completing this phase:
1. Move to **Phase 3: Implementation** for production pipeline
2. Use learnings from prototypes to guide implementation decisions
3. Continue parallel execution across 13 implementation groups
