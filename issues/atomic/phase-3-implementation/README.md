# Phase 3: Production Implementation

**Purpose:** Build the complete production pipeline from content sourcing to distribution.

**Duration:** 8-12 days  
**Team Size:** 10-20 developers  
**Priority:** P1-P2 (Mixed)

## Overview

This phase implements the full video generation pipeline. Tasks are organized into 13 logical groups that represent the end-to-end workflow from content sourcing to analytics.

## Phase Objectives

- Implement production-quality code for entire pipeline
- Build robust error handling and validation
- Create comprehensive tests for each component
- Optimize for performance and reliability
- Enable parallel execution across all stages

## Task Groups (13 groups, 52 tasks)

### 1. Content Pipeline (6 tasks) - P0/P1
Source and process raw content for video ideas.

- Reddit scraper, alternative sources, quality scoring
- Deduplication, ranking, attribution

**[View Details →](content-pipeline/)**

### 2. Idea Generation (7 tasks) - P1
Transform content into video titles and concepts.

## Execution Strategy

### Wave 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)
**Priority:** P0/P1 tasks that establish core pipeline

```
Content Pipeline (6 tasks)
├── 3 developers in parallel
└── Dependencies: Phase 2 prototypes

Idea Generation (7 tasks)
├── 4 developers in parallel
└── Dependencies: Content pipeline completion
```

### Wave 2: Content Creation (Days 4-7)
**Priority:** P1 tasks for script and media generation

```
Parallel Groups:
├── Script Development (5 tasks) - 2 devs
├── Scene Planning (3 tasks) - 2 devs
├── Audio Production (2 tasks) - 1 dev
├── Subtitle Creation (2 tasks) - 1 dev
└── Image Generation (4 tasks) - 3 devs
```

### Wave 3: Video Assembly (Days 8-10)
**Priority:** P1/P2 tasks for video creation and finishing

```
Parallel Groups:
├── Video Production (3 tasks) - 3 devs
├── Post-Production (6 tasks) - 4 devs
└── Quality Control (3 tasks) - 2 devs
```

### Wave 4: Distribution (Days 11-12)
**Priority:** P2 tasks for publishing and analytics

```
Parallel Groups:
├── Export & Delivery (3 tasks) - 2 devs
├── Distribution (4 tasks) - 3 devs
└── Analytics (4 tasks) - 2 devs
```

## Dependencies

**This Phase Requires:**
- Phase 1: Interface (all configs and schemas)
- Phase 2: Prototype (validated integration patterns)

**This Phase Blocks:**
- None (final production phase)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 52 tasks completed and tested
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline generates complete videos
- [ ] All quality checks pass
- [ ] Videos successfully upload to all platforms
- [ ] Analytics collection functioning
- [ ] Documentation complete for all components

## Task Grouping Benefits

1. **Logical Organization:** Related tasks grouped together
2. **Clear Dependencies:** Easy to see what blocks what
3. **Team Assignment:** Assign entire groups to specialists
4. **Progress Tracking:** Monitor completion by functional area
5. **Knowledge Sharing:** Developers become experts in their group

## Parallel Execution Example

**Team of 20 Developers:**
```
Week 1 (Days 1-5):
├── Group A (4 devs): Content Pipeline + Idea Generation
├── Group B (4 devs): Script Development + Scene Planning
├── Group C (4 devs): Audio + Subtitle + Image Generation
├── Group D (4 devs): Video Production (prep work)
└── Group E (4 devs): Post-Production (prep work)

Week 2 (Days 6-12):
├── Group A (4 devs): Video Production + Post-Production
├── Group B (4 devs): Quality Control + Export
├── Group C (4 devs): Distribution
├── Group D (4 devs): Analytics + Documentation
└── Group E (4 devs): Testing + Bug fixes
```

**Result:** Complete pipeline in 12 days vs 40+ days sequential!

## Priority Guidelines

- **P0:** Must complete first, blocking everything else
- **P1:** Core functionality, high value
- **P2:** Enhancement and distribution, nice-to-have

## Next Steps

1. Review individual group README files for detailed task breakdowns
2. Assign groups based on team expertise
3. Set up daily standups per group
4. Use feature branches: `feature/phase3-{group-name}-{task-id}`
5. Track progress with MicrostepValidator
