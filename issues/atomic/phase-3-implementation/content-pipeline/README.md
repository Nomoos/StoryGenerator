# Content Pipeline Group

**Phase:** 3 - Implementation  
**Tasks:** 6  
**Priority:** P0/P1  
**Duration:** 2-3 days  
**Team Size:** 3-4 developers

## Overview

This group handles content sourcing, quality assessment, and preparation for idea generation. It's the foundation of the entire content creation pipeline.

## Tasks

1. **02-content-01-reddit-scraper** (P0) - Reddit story mining and collection
2. **02-content-02-alt-sources** (P1) - Alternative content sources (Twitter, forums, etc.)
3. **02-content-03-quality-scorer** (P1) - Story quality assessment and scoring
4. **02-content-04-deduplication** (P1) - Remove duplicate or similar stories
5. **02-content-05-ranking** (P1) - Rank stories by viral potential
6. **02-content-06-attribution** (P1) - Track and attribute sources properly

## Dependencies

**Requires:**
- Phase 1: Config files with source definitions
- Phase 2: Working API client prototypes

**Blocks:**
- Idea Generation group (needs quality content)
- Script Development group (indirectly)

## Execution Strategy

```
Day 1:
├── Dev 1: Reddit scraper (P0 - critical)
├── Dev 2: Quality scorer (P1)
└── Dev 3: Alternative sources (P1)

Day 2:
├── Dev 1: Deduplication (P1)
├── Dev 2: Ranking (P1)
└── Dev 3: Attribution (P1)
```

**Tip:** Reddit scraper must complete first as other tasks depend on having content to process.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can scrape Reddit stories across multiple subreddits
- [ ] Alternative sources integrated (at least 2-3)
- [ ] Quality scorer produces consistent 0-100 scores
- [ ] Deduplication removes near-duplicates effectively
- [ ] Ranking algorithm prioritizes high-potential stories
- [ ] Attribution tracks all sources accurately

## Next Steps

After completion, the **Idea Generation** group can begin transforming ranked content into video concepts.
