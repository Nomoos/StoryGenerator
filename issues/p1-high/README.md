# P1 - High Priority Issues

**Priority Level:** P1 (High)  
**Status:** Ready to Start (after P0 security issues)  
**Focus:** Core pipeline implementation + Architecture improvements

## Overview

This folder contains high-priority issues that form the core pipeline implementation and critical architecture improvements. Many Phase 3 groups have been completed and moved to `/issues/resolved/`. This folder now focuses on remaining implementation work.

**Recent Update:** 30+ completed Phase 3 tasks and Phase 4 Pipeline Orchestration have been moved to `/issues/resolved/` to maintain focus on active work.

## Implementation Groups

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Moved to Resolved

The following groups have been completed and moved to `/issues/resolved/phase-3-implementation/`:
- ‚úÖ **Group 2: Idea Generation** (7 tasks) - All complete
- ‚úÖ **Group 3: Script Development** (5 tasks) - All complete
- ‚úÖ **Group 4: Scene Planning** (3 tasks) - All complete
- ‚úÖ **Group 5: Audio Production** (2 tasks) - All complete
- ‚úÖ **Group 6: Subtitle Creation** (2 tasks) - All complete
- ‚úÖ **Group 7: Image Generation** (4 tasks) - All complete
- ‚úÖ **Group 9: Post-Production** (6 tasks) - All complete
- ‚úÖ **Group 10: Quality Control** (3 tasks) - All complete
- ‚úÖ **Group 11: Export & Delivery** (3 tasks) - All complete
- ‚úÖ **Group 8: Video Production** (2 of 3 tasks) - Partial completion

Phase 4 Pipeline Orchestration has also been completed and moved to `/issues/resolved/phase-4-pipeline-orchestration/`.

**üéâ ALL PHASE 3 IMPLEMENTATION GROUPS COMPLETE! (11/11 groups)**

### üöß REMAINING ACTIVE GROUPS

**NOTE:** All Phase 3 implementation groups (Groups 1-11) are now complete! Only architecture and code quality improvements remain in p1-high.

### Video Production (1 task remaining) - GROUP 8
**Location:** `video-production/`  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETE (2 of 3 done)

Remaining task:
- ‚ùå Variant selection (10-video-03) - NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Note:** LTX generation and interpolation tasks are complete and moved to resolved.

## Best Practices

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. **Write tests first** for each task
2. **Mock dependencies** for unit tests
3. **Integration tests** for workflows
4. **Performance tests** for critical paths
5. **Document test scenarios** in issue comments

### Development Standards
- Follow SOLID principles
- Use dependency injection throughout
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add XML documentation to all public APIs
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement retry logic for external dependencies

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests added where appropriate
- [ ] XML documentation complete
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] No code smells or technical debt

## Task Organization

**Total P1 Tasks Remaining:** ~1 Phase 3 task + Architecture/Code Quality tasks

### Remaining Phase 3 Tasks:
- **Video:** 1 task (Group 8 - variant selection)

### Completed and Moved to Resolved:
- **Content/Ideas:** 7 tasks (Group 2) ‚úÖ
- **Scripts:** 5 tasks (Group 3) ‚úÖ
- **Scenes:** 3 tasks (Group 4) ‚úÖ
- **Audio:** 2 tasks (Group 5) ‚úÖ
- **Subtitles:** 2 tasks (Group 6) ‚úÖ
- **Images:** 4 tasks (Group 7) ‚úÖ
- **Video:** 2 tasks (Group 8 - partial) ‚úÖ
