## Implementation Groups

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Moved to Resolved

The following groups have been completed and moved to `/issues/resolved/phase-3-implementation/`:
- ‚úÖ **Group 2: Idea Generation** (7 tasks) - All complete
- ‚úÖ **Group 4: Scene Planning** (3 tasks) - All complete
- ‚úÖ **Group 6: Subtitle Creation** (2 tasks) - All complete
- ‚úÖ **Group 7: Image Generation** (4 tasks) - All complete
- ‚úÖ **Group 9: Post-Production** (6 tasks) - All complete
- ‚úÖ **Group 10: Quality Control** (3 tasks) - All complete
- ‚úÖ **Group 8: Video Production** (2 of 3 tasks) - Partial completion

Phase 4 Pipeline Orchestration has also been completed and moved to `/issues/resolved/phase-4-pipeline-orchestration/`.

### üöß REMAINING ACTIVE GROUPS

### Script Development (5 tasks) - GROUP 3
**Location:** `script-development/`  
**Status:** ‚ùå NOT STARTED

Script creation and refinement:
- Raw script generation
- Script scoring
- Iterative improvement
- GPT-based enhancement
- Title optimization

**Priority:** Must complete for end-to-end pipeline

### Audio Production (2 tasks) - GROUP 5
**Location:** `audio-production/`  
**Status:** ‚ùå NOT STARTED

Voice and audio generation:
- TTS (Text-to-Speech) generation
- Audio normalization (LUFS)

**Priority:** Critical for video synthesis and subtitle timing

### Video Production (1 task remaining) - GROUP 8
**Location:** `video-production/`  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETE (2 of 3 done)

Remaining task:
- ‚ùå Variant selection (10-video-03) - NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Note:** LTX generation and interpolation tasks are complete and moved to resolved.

### Export & Delivery (3 tasks) - GROUP 11
**Location:** `export-delivery/`  
**Status:** ‚ùå NOT STARTED

Final output preparation:
- Final encoding
- Thumbnail generation
- Metadata preparation

**Priority:** Final encoding and metadata generation

## Best Practices

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. **Write tests first** for each task
2. **Mock dependencies** for unit tests
3. **Integration tests** for workflows
4. **Performance tests** for critical paths
5. **Document test scenarios** in issue comments

### Development Standards
- Follow SOLID principles
- Use dependency injection throughout
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add XML documentation to all public APIs
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement retry logic for external dependencies

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests added where appropriate
- [ ] XML documentation complete
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] No code smells or technical debt
