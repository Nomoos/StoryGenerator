# Group 2 - Current Focus

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10  
**Status:** ðŸ”„ In Progress - Enhanced Reddit Scraper

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Priority

**Task:** Enhanced Reddit Scraper  
**Issue File:** [content-reddit-scraper-enhanced.md](.ISSUES/content-reddit-scraper-enhanced.md)  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours  
**Started:** 2025-10-10  
**Status:** ðŸ”„ In Progress

### Description

Enhancing the existing Reddit scraper (`scripts/reddit_scraper.py`) with:
- âœ… Incremental scraping with state persistence
- âœ… SQLite-based persistent duplicate tracking
- âœ… Enhanced rate limiting with exponential backoff
- âœ… Configurable quality thresholds per demographic
- âœ… Command-line arguments for flexible operation

### Progress

- [x] Add incremental scraping with state persistence (JSON-based)
- [x] Add SQLite duplicate tracking database
- [x] Add exponential backoff rate limiting decorator
- [x] Add configurable quality thresholds by age bucket
- [x] Add command-line interface (--segment, --age, --no-incremental, --no-dedup, --force-full)
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility with existing tests
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for new features
- [ ] Update documentation

### Blockers

None - implementation is complete, pending tests and documentation.

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Group 2 Tasks

1. âœ… **Enhanced Reddit Scraper** - ðŸ”„ In Progress (90% complete)
2. [ ] **Social Media Sources** - Instagram and TikTok scrapers (6-8h)
3. [ ] **Enhanced Deduplication** - Fuzzy matching and semantic similarity (4-6h)

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. âœ… Review and confirm 3 task definitions in `.ISSUES/`
2. [ ] Assign tasks to developers
3. [ ] Begin implementation following TDD principles
4. [ ] Update this file as work progresses
5. [ ] Move completed tasks to `.DONE/` upon completion

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Task Order

For sequential implementation:
1. **First:** Enhanced Reddit Scraper (foundation for content collection)
2. **Second:** Content Deduplication (applies to all sources)
3. **Third:** Social Media Sources (adds alternative content sources)

For parallel implementation:
- All three tasks can be worked on simultaneously by different developers
