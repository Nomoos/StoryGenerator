# Group 2 - Current Focus

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10
**Status:** 📋 Ready to start - Content pipeline tasks available

---

## 🎯 Current Priority

**Phase:** Content to Script Pipeline
**Total Unfinished Tasks:** 3 issues (14-20 hours estimated)
**Next Recommended Task:** content-reddit-scraper-enhanced (4-6h) or content-deduplication (4-6h)

### Recently Completed
✅ **Idea Generation Pipeline** - All 7 tasks complete (Reddit adaptation, LLM generation, clustering, title generation, scoring)
- See: [group-2-idea-generation](../../issues/resolved/phase-3-implementation/group-2-idea-generation/)

### Current Stage
Group 2 now focuses on **enhanced content collection** including:
- Reddit scraping with better filtering and rate limiting
- Alternative content sources (Instagram, TikTok)
- Content deduplication across sources

**Independence:** ✅ Highly independent - Self-contained from content sourcing through final script, minimal dependencies on other groups

## 📋 Recommended Execution Order

**Can be executed in parallel** - All tasks are independent:
1. content-reddit-scraper-enhanced (4-6h) - Start first, provides content source
2. content-deduplication (4-6h) - Can start in parallel
3. content-social-media-sources (6-8h) - Adds more content sources

**Parallelization:** All 3 tasks can be worked simultaneously by different team members.

**Dependencies:**
- Requires `infrastructure-configuration` from Group 1 (for API credentials)
- Otherwise independent and can start immediately

---

## 🚧 Blockers / Risks

**Current Blockers:** None - all tasks are independent and ready to start

**Potential Risks:**
- **API Rate Limits:** Reddit and social media APIs have rate limits
  - *Mitigation:* Implement proper rate limiting and retry logic
- **API Access:** Requires API credentials for Reddit, Instagram, TikTok
  - *Mitigation:* Document API setup in each task, provide fallback options
