### Description

Expand alternative content sources by adding Instagram and TikTok scrapers to complement existing Quora and Twitter scrapers.

### Key Features to Implement
- Instagram scraper following BaseScraper interface
- TikTok scraper following BaseScraper interface
- Integration with unified CLI (`alt_sources_scraper.py`)
- Mock data implementation for testing
- Age-appropriate content filtering
- Rate limiting for each platform

### Dependencies
- Builds on: `scripts/scrapers/` (existing alternative sources)
- Optional: Platform API credentials (mock implementation available)

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. âœ… Review and confirm 3 task definitions in `.ISSUES/`
2. [ ] Assign tasks to developers
3. [ ] Begin implementation following TDD principles
4. [ ] Update this file as work progresses
5. [ ] Move completed tasks to `.DONE/` upon completion

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Task Order

For sequential implementation:
1. **First:** Enhanced Reddit Scraper (foundation for content collection)
2. **Second:** Content Deduplication (applies to all sources)
3. **Third:** Social Media Sources (adds alternative content sources)

For parallel implementation:
- All three tasks can be worked on simultaneously by different developers
