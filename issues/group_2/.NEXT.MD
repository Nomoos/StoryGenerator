# Group 2 - Current Focus

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10  
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Ready to start - 3 tasks defined

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Priority

**Task:** Content Pipeline Enhancements (3 issues)  
**Total Estimated Effort:** 14-20 hours  
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Not Started

### Overview

Group 2 focuses on enhancing the content pipeline with three key improvements:

1. **Enhanced Reddit Scraper** (4-6h) - Multi-subreddit support, incremental updates, duplicate detection
2. **Social Media Sources** (6-8h) - Instagram and TikTok content collection
3. **Content Deduplication** (4-6h) - Fuzzy matching and semantic similarity detection

### Unfinished Tasks

1. [content-reddit-scraper-enhanced.md](.ISSUES/content-reddit-scraper-enhanced.md) - P1, 4-6 hours
2. [content-social-media-sources.md](.ISSUES/content-social-media-sources.md) - P1, 6-8 hours
3. [content-deduplication.md](.ISSUES/content-deduplication.md) - P1, 4-6 hours

### Task Dependencies

- **Reddit Scraper Enhanced**: Can start immediately (builds on existing `scripts/reddit_scraper.py`)
- **Social Media Sources**: Can work in parallel with Reddit scraper
- **Deduplication**: Best implemented after scrapers are enhanced (can work in parallel)

### Notes

- All tasks are P1 (High Priority)
- Tasks can be worked on in parallel
- Existing Reddit scraper at `scripts/reddit_scraper.py` provides foundation
- Related completed work in `/issues/resolved/p0-content-pipeline/02-content-01-reddit-scraper/`

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. âœ… Review and confirm 3 task definitions in `.ISSUES/`
2. [ ] Assign tasks to developers
3. [ ] Begin implementation following TDD principles
4. [ ] Update this file as work progresses
5. [ ] Move completed tasks to `.DONE/` upon completion

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Task Order

For sequential implementation:
1. **First:** Enhanced Reddit Scraper (foundation for content collection)
2. **Second:** Content Deduplication (applies to all sources)
3. **Third:** Social Media Sources (adds alternative content sources)

For parallel implementation:
- All three tasks can be worked on simultaneously by different developers
