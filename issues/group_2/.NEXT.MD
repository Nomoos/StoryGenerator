## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Task Order

For sequential implementation:
1. **First:** Enhanced Reddit Scraper (foundation for content collection)
2. **Second:** Content Deduplication (applies to all sources)
3. **Third:** Social Media Sources (adds alternative content sources)

For parallel implementation:
- All three tasks can be worked on simultaneously by different developers
