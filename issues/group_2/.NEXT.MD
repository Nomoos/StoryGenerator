## ðŸŽ¯ Recently Completed Tasks

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Task 1: Enhanced Reddit Scraper âœ…  
**Issue File:** [content-reddit-scraper-enhanced.md](.DONE/content-reddit-scraper-enhanced.md)  
**Completed:** 2025-10-10 | **Effort:** 5 hours

**Features:**
- Incremental scraping with JSON state persistence
- SQLite-based persistent duplicate tracking
- Enhanced rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Configurable quality thresholds per demographic
- CLI arguments for flexible operation

### Task 2: Enhanced Content Deduplication âœ…  
**Issue File:** [content-deduplication.md](.DONE/content-deduplication.md)  
**Completed:** 2025-10-10 | **Effort:** 4 hours

**Features:**
- Advanced fuzzy matching using Levenshtein distance
- Semantic similarity detection using sentence embeddings
- Configurable thresholds (--fuzzy-threshold, --semantic-threshold)
- CLI arguments (--no-fuzzy, --no-semantic)
- Enhanced reporting with similarity scores
- Backward compatible with v1.0

## ðŸ“‹ Next Task: Social Media Sources

**Task:** Alternative Social Media Sources (Instagram & TikTok)  
**Issue File:** [content-social-media-sources.md](.ISSUES/content-social-media-sources.md)  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours  
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Ready to start

### Description

Expand alternative content sources by adding Instagram and TikTok scrapers to complement existing Quora and Twitter scrapers.

### Key Features to Implement
- Instagram scraper following BaseScraper interface
- TikTok scraper following BaseScraper interface
- Integration with unified CLI (`alt_sources_scraper.py`)
- Mock data implementation for testing
- Age-appropriate content filtering
- Rate limiting for each platform

### Dependencies
- Builds on: `scripts/scrapers/` (existing alternative sources)
- Optional: Platform API credentials (mock implementation available)

## ðŸ“Š Group 2 Progress Summary

**Overall Status:** 2/3 tasks complete (67%)

| Task | Status | Effort | Features |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| 1. Enhanced Reddit Scraper | âœ… Complete | 5h | Incremental scraping, duplicate tracking, rate limiting |
| 2. Enhanced Deduplication | âœ… Complete | 4h | Fuzzy matching, semantic similarity |
| 3. Social Media Sources | ðŸ“‹ Not Started | 6-8h | Instagram & TikTok scrapers |

**Completed:** 9 hours  
**Remaining:** 6-8 hours  
**Total Estimated:** 15-19 hours
=======
**Phase:** Content to Script Pipeline
**Total Unfinished Tasks:** 3 issues (14-20 hours estimated)
**Next Recommended Task:** content-reddit-scraper-enhanced (4-6h) or content-deduplication (4-6h)

### Recently Completed
âœ… **Idea Generation Pipeline** - All 7 tasks complete (Reddit adaptation, LLM generation, clustering, title generation, scoring)
- See: [group-2-idea-generation](../../issues/resolved/phase-3-implementation/group-2-idea-generation/)

### Current Stage
Group 2 now focuses on **enhanced content collection** including:
- Reddit scraping with better filtering and rate limiting
- Alternative content sources (Instagram, TikTok)
- Content deduplication across sources

**Independence:** âœ… Highly independent - Self-contained from content sourcing through final script, minimal dependencies on other groups

---

## ðŸ“Š Unfinished Tasks Summary

### Content Collection (3 tasks, 14-20h)
1. **content-reddit-scraper-enhanced** - Enhanced Reddit scraper (4-6h) - P1
2. **content-deduplication** - Deduplication system (4-6h) - P1
3. **content-social-media-sources** - Alternative content sources (6-8h) - P1

**Total Effort:** 14-20 hours across 3 tasks

## ðŸ“‹ Recommended Execution Order

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. âœ… Review and confirm 3 task definitions in `.ISSUES/`
2. [ ] Assign tasks to developers
3. [ ] Begin implementation following TDD principles
4. [ ] Update this file as work progresses
5. [ ] Move completed tasks to `.DONE/` upon completion
=======
**Can be executed in parallel** - All tasks are independent:
1. content-reddit-scraper-enhanced (4-6h) - Start first, provides content source
2. content-deduplication (4-6h) - Can start in parallel
3. content-social-media-sources (6-8h) - Adds more content sources

**Parallelization:** All 3 tasks can be worked simultaneously by different team members.

**Dependencies:**
- Requires `infrastructure-configuration` from Group 1 (for API credentials)
- Otherwise independent and can start immediately

---

## ðŸš§ Blockers / Risks

**Current Blockers:** None - all tasks are independent and ready to start

**Potential Risks:**
- **API Rate Limits:** Reddit and social media APIs have rate limits
  - *Mitigation:* Implement proper rate limiting and retry logic
- **API Access:** Requires API credentials for Reddit, Instagram, TikTok
  - *Mitigation:* Document API setup in each task, provide fallback options

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Task Order

For sequential implementation:
1. **First:** Enhanced Reddit Scraper (foundation for content collection)
2. **Second:** Content Deduplication (applies to all sources)
3. **Third:** Social Media Sources (adds alternative content sources)

<<<<<<< HEAD
For parallel implementation:
- All three tasks can be worked on simultaneously by different developers
