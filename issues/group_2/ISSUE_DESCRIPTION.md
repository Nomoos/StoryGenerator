## Current Focus (`.NEXT.MD`)

**Phase:** Content to Script Pipeline Enhancement
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Ready to start - 3 tasks available (14-20 hours)

### Recently Completed
âœ… **Idea Generation Pipeline** - All 7 tasks complete (Reddit adaptation, LLM generation, clustering, title generation, scoring, voice recommendations, top selection)
- See: [group-2-idea-generation](issues/resolved/phase-3-implementation/group-2-idea-generation/)

### Available Work
Group 2 now focuses on **enhanced content collection**:
- 3 Content Collection tasks (14-20h)

**Next Recommended:** `content-reddit-scraper-enhanced` (4-6h) or `content-deduplication` (4-6h)

## Unfinished Tasks

### ðŸ“¦ Content Collection & Sourcing (14-20h)

1. **Enhanced Reddit Scraper** ([content-reddit-scraper-enhanced.md](issues/group_2/.ISSUES/content-reddit-scraper-enhanced.md)) - 4-6h - P1
   - Multi-subreddit scraping with better filtering and rate limiting
   - Incremental updates (fetch only new content)
   - Content quality filtering (score, length, engagement)
   - JSON output with full metadata

2. **Content Deduplication System** ([content-deduplication.md](issues/group_2/.ISSUES/content-deduplication.md)) - 4-6h - P1
   - Exact duplicate detection (hash-based)
   - Near-duplicate detection (fuzzy matching)
   - Semantic similarity detection (embeddings)
   - Configurable similarity thresholds
   - Duplicate tracking and reporting

3. **Alternative Content Sources** ([content-social-media-sources.md](issues/group_2/.ISSUES/content-social-media-sources.md)) - 6-8h - P1
   - Instagram content scraping
   - TikTok content scraping
   - Content normalization across sources
   - Quality scoring across platforms
   - API credential management

## Blockers/Risks

### Current Blockers
**None** - All tasks are independent and ready to start

### Potential Risks

ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Risk:**
- **API Rate Limits:** Reddit, Instagram, TikTok APIs have strict rate limits
  - *Mitigation:* Implement proper rate limiting, retry logic, caching
- **API Access Requirements:** Need API credentials for each platform
  - *Mitigation:* Document setup clearly, provide mock/test data

ðŸŸ¢ **Low Risk:**
- **API Changes:** Social media APIs may change
  - *Mitigation:* Use maintained libraries (praw, instaloader), pin versions
- **Content Quality Variance:** Different platforms have different quality
  - *Mitigation:* Platform-specific filters, content normalization

---

## Execution Strategy

### Recommended Order
1. **Phase 1:** content-reddit-scraper-enhanced (establish primary source)
2. **Phase 2:** content-deduplication + content-social-media-sources (parallel)

### Parallelization
All tasks are independent and can be worked in parallel by different team members.

### Timeline
- **With 1 developer:** 2-2.5 weeks sequential
- **With 2-3 developers:** 1-1.5 weeks with parallel work
