## Blockers/Risks

### Current Blockers
- **None** - Both tasks are ready to start

### Potential Risks
1. **GPU Requirements:**
   - Voice cloning: CUDA/GPU recommended for optimal training
   - Style consistency: Requires GPU with 12GB+ VRAM
   - **Mitigation:** Both can work with CPU but performance will be slower

2. **Dependencies:**
   - Voice cloning requires audio production infrastructure
   - Style consistency requires SDXL infrastructure
   - **Mitigation:** Core infrastructure appears to be in place from resolved tasks

3. **Integration Complexity:**
   - Both features need to integrate with existing pipeline
   - Voice profiles and style libraries need management system
   - **Mitigation:** Follow established patterns from resolved groups

### Technical Dependencies
- ‚úÖ Scripts from Group 2 (completed)
- ‚úÖ Foundation infrastructure from Group 1
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Audio production infrastructure (partial - basic TTS exists, cloning is enhancement)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Image generation infrastructure (partial - basic SDXL exists, style consistency is enhancement)

## Contributing

When working on Group 3 tasks:

1. **Pick a task** from `.ISSUES/`
2. **Update `.NEXT.MD`** to reflect your focus
3. **Follow TDD principles** - tests first
4. **Update progress** in the task file regularly
5. **Move to `.DONE/`** when complete
6. **Sync roadmap** - Update HYBRID_ROADMAP.md

Use feature branches: `feature/group3-{task-name}`
