## Current Focus (`.NEXT.MD`)

**Task:** Audio Production: Voice Cloning System  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 hours  
**Status:** üìã Not Started

### Description

Implement voice cloning system to create custom voices for different audience segments using Coqui TTS. This enables creation of multiple voice profiles per age/gender segment with quality validation and A/B testing framework.

### Key Features
- Voice cloning from reference samples (5-10 minutes of audio)
- Multiple voice profiles per age/gender segment
- Voice quality validation
- Voice embedding storage and reuse
- TTS generation with cloned voices
- A/B testing framework for voice variants

**Full Details:** [.ISSUES/audio-voice-cloning.md](.ISSUES/audio-voice-cloning.md)

- [ ] Unit tests with sample voices

### 2. Image Generation: Style Consistency System
- **Priority:** P1 (High)
- **Effort:** 6-8 hours
- **Status:** üìã Not Started
- **Dependencies:**
  - diffusers>=0.25.0, ip-adapter>=1.0.0
  - SDXL infrastructure from Group 3
  - GPU with 12GB+ VRAM
- **File:** [.ISSUES/image-style-consistency.md](.ISSUES/image-style-consistency.md)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Style reference image selection/creation
- [ ] Style transfer to all keyframes
- [ ] Visual coherence scoring across frames
- [ ] Color palette consistency
- [ ] Character/object consistency across frames
- [ ] Style library for different video types
- [ ] Unit tests for style consistency

## Blockers/Risks

### Current Blockers
- **None** - Both tasks are ready to start

### Potential Risks
1. **GPU Requirements:**
   - Voice cloning: CUDA/GPU recommended for optimal training
   - Style consistency: Requires GPU with 12GB+ VRAM
   - **Mitigation:** Both can work with CPU but performance will be slower

2. **Dependencies:**
   - Voice cloning requires audio production infrastructure
   - Style consistency requires SDXL infrastructure
   - **Mitigation:** Core infrastructure appears to be in place from resolved tasks

3. **Integration Complexity:**
   - Both features need to integrate with existing pipeline
   - Voice profiles and style libraries need management system
   - **Mitigation:** Follow established patterns from resolved groups

### Technical Dependencies
- ‚úÖ Scripts from Group 2 (completed)
- ‚úÖ Foundation infrastructure from Group 1
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Audio production infrastructure (partial - basic TTS exists, cloning is enhancement)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Image generation infrastructure (partial - basic SDXL exists, style consistency is enhancement)

## Timeline & Effort

**Total Effort:** 14-18 hours  
**Tasks:** 2  
**Priority:** P1 (High)

**Suggested Sequence:**
1. Voice Cloning (8-10h) - Audio enhancement
2. Style Consistency (6-8h) - Visual enhancement

**Parallelization:** These tasks can be worked on independently by different developers if team capacity allows.
