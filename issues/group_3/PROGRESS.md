## Current Focus (`.NEXT.MD`)

**Task:** Image Generation: Style Consistency System  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours  
**Status:** üîÑ In Progress

### Description

Implement style consistency system for SDXL keyframe generation to ensure visual coherence across all images in a video using IP-Adapter. This enables style transfer, visual coherence scoring, and maintaining consistent aesthetics across all generated keyframes.

### Key Features
- Style reference image selection/creation
- Style transfer to all keyframes using IP-Adapter
- Visual coherence scoring across frames
- Color palette consistency
- Character/object consistency validation
- Style library for different video types

**Full Details:** [.ISSUES/image-style-consistency.md](.ISSUES/image-style-consistency.md)

### Recently Completed

‚úÖ **Audio Production: Voice Cloning System** (Completed 2025-10-10)
- Full implementation with Coqui TTS
- 18 unit tests, all passing
- Comprehensive documentation
- See: [.DONE/audio-voice-cloning.md](.DONE/audio-voice-cloning.md)

## Blockers/Risks

### Current Blockers
- **None** - Both tasks are ready to start

### Potential Risks
1. **GPU Requirements:**
   - Voice cloning: CUDA/GPU recommended for optimal training
   - Style consistency: Requires GPU with 12GB+ VRAM
   - **Mitigation:** Both can work with CPU but performance will be slower

2. **Dependencies:**
   - Voice cloning requires audio production infrastructure
   - Style consistency requires SDXL infrastructure
   - **Mitigation:** Core infrastructure appears to be in place from resolved tasks

3. **Integration Complexity:**
   - Both features need to integrate with existing pipeline
   - Voice profiles and style libraries need management system
   - **Mitigation:** Follow established patterns from resolved groups

### Technical Dependencies
- ‚úÖ Scripts from Group 2 (completed)
- ‚úÖ Foundation infrastructure from Group 1
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Audio production infrastructure (partial - basic TTS exists, cloning is enhancement)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Image generation infrastructure (partial - basic SDXL exists, style consistency is enhancement)
