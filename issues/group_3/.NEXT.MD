## ðŸŽ¯ Current Priority

**Task:** Audio Production: Voice Cloning System  
**Issue File:** [.ISSUES/audio-voice-cloning.md](.ISSUES/audio-voice-cloning.md)  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 hours  
**Started:** Not yet started

### Description

Implement voice cloning system to create custom voices for different audience segments. Use Coqui TTS or similar for voice cloning from reference audio samples. This will enable creation of multiple voice profiles per age/gender segment with quality validation and A/B testing framework.

### Progress

- [ ] Install and configure Coqui TTS (TTS>=0.20.0)
- [ ] Implement VoiceCloner class with voice embedding extraction
- [ ] Add voice profile storage and management
- [ ] Implement synthesis with cloned voices
- [ ] Create voice quality validation system
- [ ] Add A/B testing framework for voice variants
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests with sample voices
- [ ] Document API and usage examples

### Blockers

- Requires CUDA/GPU for optimal training performance (recommended but not blocking)
- Audio production infrastructure from Group 3 should be in place

## ðŸ“‹ Upcoming Tasks

After completing voice cloning:

**Next:** Image Generation: Style Consistency System  
**Issue File:** [.ISSUES/image-style-consistency.md](.ISSUES/image-style-consistency.md)  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours

Implement style consistency system for SDXL keyframe generation to ensure visual coherence across all images in a video using IP-Adapter or similar for style transfer.
