## ðŸŽ¯ Current Priority

**Task:** Image Generation: Style Consistency System  
**Issue File:** [.ISSUES/image-style-consistency.md](.ISSUES/image-style-consistency.md)  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours  
**Started:** 2025-10-10

### Description

Implement style consistency system for SDXL keyframe generation to ensure visual coherence across all images in a video. Use IP-Adapter or similar for style transfer and consistency. This will enable style reference image selection/creation, style transfer to all keyframes, and visual coherence scoring.

### Progress

- [ ] Install and configure diffusers and IP-Adapter
- [ ] Implement StyleConsistencyManager class
- [ ] Add style reference image generation
- [ ] Implement style transfer to keyframes
- [ ] Create visual coherence scoring system
- [ ] Add color palette consistency validation
- [ ] Add character/object consistency checks
- [ ] Build style library management
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Document API and usage examples

### Blockers

- Requires GPU with 12GB+ VRAM for optimal performance
- SDXL infrastructure should be in place

### Recently Completed

âœ… **Audio Production: Voice Cloning System** (Completed 2025-10-10)
- Implemented VoiceCloner with Coqui TTS integration
- 378 lines of production code + 456 lines of tests
- Complete documentation in VOICE_CLONING_GUIDE.md
