## ðŸ“Š Status Overview

> **ðŸ’¡ Quick Summary:** See the [Hybrid Roadmap](../docs/HYBRID_ROADMAP.md) for detailed progress tracking and architecture overview.

| Priority | Status | Task Count | Estimated Effort |
|----------|--------|------------|------------------|
| âœ… Resolved | Complete | 15 tasks | ~65 hours (done) |
| ðŸ”´ P0 Critical | Complete | 0 tasks | 0 hours (ALL DONE âœ…) |
| ðŸ”„ **Pipeline Foundation** | **In Progress** | **5 tasks** | **~30 hours** |
| ðŸŸ¡ P1 High | Not Started | 47 tasks | 160-250 hours |
| ðŸŸ¢ P2 Medium | Not Started | 18 tasks | 110-135 hours |
| **Total** | | **85 tasks** | **335-480 hours** |

> **Note:** All P0 critical issues are complete! Currently working on pipeline orchestration foundation, then P1 high-priority tasks.

**Priority-Based Organization:** All P0 issues are complete! Focus now shifts to P1 high-priority tasks for core pipeline implementation.

## Usage

### Priority-Based Development Workflow

#### 1. Start with P0 - Critical Priority ðŸ”´
```bash
cd issues/p0-critical/
# Review README.md for overview
# Pick a task and follow TDD practices
```

**Focus:** Complete ALL P0 tasks before moving to P1. These are blockers.

#### 2. Move to P1 - High Priority ðŸŸ¡
```bash
cd issues/p1-high/
# Review task groups
# Many tasks can be parallelized
```

**Focus:** Core pipeline implementation. Can work on multiple groups simultaneously.

#### 3. Tackle P2 - Medium Priority ðŸŸ¢
```bash
cd issues/p2-medium/
# Platform distribution
# Analytics and optimization
```

**Focus:** Publishing and analytics features after core pipeline works.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow

For each task:
1. **Read acceptance criteria** in issue.md
2. **Write tests first** (Red phase)
   ```bash
   # Create test file
   # Define expected behavior
   # Run tests - they should fail
   ```
3. **Implement minimal code** (Green phase)
   ```bash
   # Write just enough code to pass tests
   # Keep it simple
   ```
4. **Refactor and improve** (Refactor phase)
   ```bash
   # Clean up code
   # Improve design
   # Tests still pass
   ```
5. **Document and review**
   ```bash
   # Add XML documentation
   # Submit for peer review
   ```

### Resolved Issues (Historical Reference)

For completed work and examples:
```bash
cd issues/resolved/
# View completed implementations
# Use as reference for similar tasks
```
3. **Move to Phase 2** (Prototype) - Validate all integrations
4. **Execute Phase 3** (Implementation) - Build production pipeline in 13 groups
5. **Track** progress using MicrostepValidator per task
6. **Complete** pipeline 5-10x faster than sequential with proper phasing

## Phase-Based Execution Benefits

- **Clear progression**: Interface â†’ Prototype â†’ Implementation
- **Reduced rework**: Validate before building full implementation
- **Better coordination**: Teams work within logical phase boundaries
- **10 developers**: Complete in ~11-17 days (vs 4-6 weeks sequential)
- **20 developers**: Complete in ~7-11 days with full parallelization
- **Granular progress**: Track 64 atomic completions across 3 phases
- **Resource optimization**: Match task difficulty to developer skills within each phase
- **Flexible scheduling**: Pause/resume entire phases or individual groups independently
