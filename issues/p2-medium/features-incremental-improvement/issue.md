# Feature: Incremental Content Improvement System

**ID:** `features-incremental-improvement`  
**Priority:** P2  
**Effort:** 8-12 hours  
**Status:** Not Started

## Overview

Implement an iterative improvement system that allows continuous refinement of generated content (scripts, titles, scenes) based on:
- Historical improvement data
- User feedback
- Quality metrics tracking
- Automated suggestions

This feature was implemented in the obsolete Python version (`GIncrementalImprover.py`) and provides significant value for content quality optimization.

## Dependencies

**Requires:**
- `05-script-*` (Script generation and improvement)
- Quality scoring system
- Storage for improvement history

**Blocks:**
- Advanced content optimization workflows
- A/B testing capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] C# implementation of incremental improver
- [ ] Improvement history tracking (JSON/SQLite)
- [ ] User feedback integration
- [ ] GPT-based quality analysis
- [ ] Automated improvement suggestions
- [ ] Apply specific improvements (regenerate_scenes, improve_descriptions, etc.)
- [ ] Progress tracking and metrics
- [ ] Documentation with examples
- [ ] Unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests with existing generators

## Task Details

### Key Features from Python Implementation

The obsolete Python version (`obsolete/Python/Generators/GIncrementalImprover.py`) included:

1. **Improvement History**
   - Load/save improvement history to JSON
   - Track what improvements were applied and their results
   - Maintain version history of content

2. **User Feedback Integration**
   - Collect user feedback on generated content
   - Analyze feedback using GPT
   - Generate actionable improvement suggestions

3. **Quality Analysis**
   - GPT-based quality assessment
   - Identify issues, suggestions, and priorities
   - Compare before/after quality scores

4. **Improvement Actions**
   - `regenerate_scenes` - Re-analyze with different parameters
   - `improve_descriptions` - Enhance scene descriptions
   - `regenerate_keyframes` - Generate new keyframes
   - `adjust_timing` - Optimize scene timing
   - Custom improvement pipelines

5. **Metrics Tracking**
   - Track improvement effectiveness
   - Monitor quality trends over iterations
   - Export improvement reports

### Implementation Approach

```csharp
namespace StoryGenerator.Generators;

public interface IIncrementalImprover
{
    Task<ImprovementHistory> LoadHistoryAsync(string storyTitle);
    Task<QualityAnalysis> AnalyzeQualityAsync(IStoryIdea idea, string userFeedback);
    Task<ImprovementResult> ApplyImprovementsAsync(IStoryIdea idea, IEnumerable<string> improvements);
    Task SaveHistoryAsync(string storyTitle, ImprovementHistory history);
}
```

### Storage

Store improvement history in:
- **JSON files:** `data/improvements/{segment}/{age}/{title_id}_history.json`
- **OR SQLite:** Table `improvement_history` with versioning

### Testing

```bash
# Unit tests
dotnet test --filter "Category=IncrementalImprover"
```

## Output Files

```
data/improvements/
└── {segment}/
    └── {age}/
        └── {title_id}_history.json
```
