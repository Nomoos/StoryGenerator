# Features: Implement Async/Concurrent Processing

**ID:** `features-async-processing`  
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)  
**Effort:** 10-12 hours  
**Status:** Not Started

## Overview

Sequential processing is slow. Implement async/concurrent processing to generate multiple videos in parallel.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Async API calls
- [ ] Parallel video generation
- [ ] Concurrent file I/O
- [ ] Worker pool management
- [ ] Progress tracking

## Task Details

```python
import asyncio
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

async def generate_all_segments():
    tasks = [
        generate_segment(gender, age)
        for gender in ['men', 'women']
        for age in ['10-13', '14-17', '18-23']
    ]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results
```
