## 🔑 Key Concepts Summary

### SOLID Principles

| Principle | What It Means | When to Use |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Single Responsibility** | One class, one job | Always - every class should have a single, clear purpose |
| **Open/Closed** | Extend, don't modify | When designing extensible systems (new synthesizers, providers) |
| **Liskov Substitution** | Implementations are interchangeable | When using inheritance or interfaces (all IVideoSynthesizer implementations must work the same) |
| **Interface Segregation** | Small, focused interfaces | When designing public APIs (IIdeaGenerator vs giant IContentGenerator) |
| **Dependency Inversion** | Depend on abstractions | Always - use interfaces in constructors, not concrete classes |

### OOP Pillars

| Pillar | What It Means | Example in Our Code |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Hide internal details | Private fields with public properties that validate |
| **Inheritance** | Extend base classes | VideoSynthesizerBase → LTXVideoSynthesizer |
| **Polymorphism** | Same interface, different behavior | IVideoSynthesizer has multiple implementations |
| **Abstraction** | Hide complexity | IVideoPostProducer hides multi-step processing |

### Clean Code Practices

| Practice | What It Means | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Meaningful Names** | Clear, descriptive names | `ScriptScoringResult` not `SSR` |
| **Small Functions** | < 20 lines, do one thing | Split large methods into focused helpers |
| **Comments** | Explain why, not what | XML docs on public APIs, sparse inline comments |
| **Error Handling** | Validate early, handle gracefully | Throw ArgumentException for invalid input, custom exceptions for domain errors |
| **DRY** | Don't Repeat Yourself | Extract common logic into reusable methods |
| **KISS** | Keep It Simple | Don't over-engineer, use simplest solution that works |

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns in Use

### Current Codebase Patterns

1. **Factory Pattern** - `VideoSynthesizerFactory` creates synthesizers
2. **Facade Pattern** - `PipelineOrchestrator` simplifies complex operations
3. **Strategy Pattern** - `IVideoSynthesizer` implementations provide different strategies
4. **Template Method** - Base classes define workflow, subclasses implement details
5. **Dependency Injection** - Throughout the codebase
6. **Retry Pattern** - `RetryService` with Polly library
7. **Circuit Breaker** - In `RetryService` for fault tolerance
8. **Options Pattern** - Configuration via strongly-typed options classes
9. **Repository Pattern** - File-based storage with interfaces
10. **Pipeline Pattern** - Multi-stage processing (idea → script → voice → video)

## 💡 FAQs

### Q: Should I use SOLID or OOP or Clean Code?

**A:** Use all three together! They complement each other:
- **SOLID** guides your architecture and class design
- **OOP** provides implementation patterns
- **Clean Code** ensures readability and maintainability

### Q: When should I create an interface?

**A:** Create an interface when:
- It's a public API (others will depend on it)
- You'll have multiple implementations (OpenAI vs local LLM)
- You need to mock it for testing
- You want to follow DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)

See decision tree in [QUICK_REFERENCE_SOLID_OOP_CLEAN_CODE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE_SOLID_OOP_CLEAN_CODE.md)

### Q: When should I use inheritance vs composition?

**A:** Use inheritance only for true "is-a" relationships with shared implementation. Otherwise, prefer composition.

See decision tree in [QUICK_REFERENCE_SOLID_OOP_CLEAN_CODE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE_SOLID_OOP_CLEAN_CODE.md)

### Q: How do I know if my class follows SRP?

**A:** Ask: "Does this class have only one reason to change?" If it has multiple responsibilities, split it.

Example: `VideoProcessor` that generates, scores, and saves videos has 3 reasons to change → split into 3 classes.

### Q: What's the difference between this and the other guides?

**A:** 
- **This suite:** Principles and architecture (SOLID, OOP, Clean Code)
- **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md:** Python → C# conversion patterns
- **INTERFACES_GUIDE.md:** Specific interface patterns for video synthesis
- **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md:** General implementation patterns

### Q: Where do I start?

**A:** 
1. Read this index (you're here! ✅)
2. Skim [SOLID_OOP_CLEAN_CODE_GUIDE.md](SOLID_OOP_CLEAN_CODE_GUIDE.md) Executive Summary (5 min)
3. Keep [QUICK_REFERENCE_SOLID_OOP_CLEAN_CODE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE_SOLID_OOP_CLEAN_CODE.md) open while coding
