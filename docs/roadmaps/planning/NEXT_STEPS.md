## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Actions

### 1. Production Deployment
**Why:** Get the system into production and start generating real value  
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up production environment
- [ ] Configure environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY, ELEVENLABS_API_KEY)
- [ ] Deploy application
- [ ] Set up monitoring with lifecycle hooks
- [ ] Test end-to-end in production

**Owner:** DevOps + Development

### 2. User Acceptance Testing
**Why:** Validate system works as expected with real data  
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Run full pipeline with real story ideas using `storygen run`
- [ ] Test checkpoint/resume with actual interruptions
- [ ] Test declarative pipeline configuration with YAML files
- [ ] Validate retry and error handling in production scenarios
- [ ] Document any issues or improvements needed

**Owner:** QA + Product

## ðŸ“Š Quick Wins

### 3. Infrastructure Improvements
**Why:** Strengthen foundation before building more features  
**Priority Issues:**
- `infrastructure-logging` - Better structured logging (integrated with lifecycle hooks)
- `infrastructure-configuration` - Enhanced config management (declarative YAML/JSON complete)
- `infrastructure-testing` - More comprehensive tests (42 orchestration tests complete)

### 4. Code Quality
**Why:** Improve maintainability and reliability  
**Priority Issues:**
- `code-quality-error-handling` - Enhanced error handling (retry logic with exponential backoff complete)
- `code-quality-input-validation` - Input validation (config validation complete)
- `code-quality-code-style` - Standardized code style

## ðŸš€ Major Features

### 5. Complete Video Pipeline Stages
**Status:** Most core stages complete, video generation stages remaining

**Completed:**
- âœ… Content Pipeline (Reddit scraping, quality scoring)
- âœ… Idea Generation (LLM-based, clustering, title generation)
- âœ… Script Development (generation, revision, enhancement)
- âœ… Scene Planning (beat sheets, shotlists)
- âœ… Audio Production (TTS, normalization)
- âœ… Subtitle Creation (ASR, forced alignment)
- âœ… Image Generation (SDXL keyframes)
- âœ… Post-Production (cropping, subtitle burn-in)
- âœ… Quality Control (A/V sync, previews)
- âœ… Export & Delivery (encoding, thumbnails)

**Remaining:**
1. **Video Production** (1 of 3 tasks remaining)
   - LTX-Video synthesis refinement

## ðŸ’¡ Key Recommendations

1. **Leverage New Orchestration Features** - Use declarative YAML configs for pipeline variants
2. **Utilize Lifecycle Hooks** - Implement monitoring and telemetry with OnStageStart/Complete/Error
3. **Test Retry Logic** - Validate exponential backoff in production scenarios
4. **Document Pipeline Configs** - Create configuration examples for different use cases
5. **Monitor Performance** - Track metrics using the comprehensive logging system
6. **Iterate on Config** - Adjust stage parameters based on production results
