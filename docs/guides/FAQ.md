# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is StoryGenerator?

StoryGenerator is an AI-driven video content pipeline that creates engaging short-form vertical videos for TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels. It automates the process from story idea to final video with voiceovers and subtitles.

### What does the pipeline currently do?

**Currently Implemented**:
- âœ… Story idea generation with metadata
- âœ… AI-generated scripts (~360 words, optimized for engagement)
- âœ… Script revision for voice clarity
- âœ… AI voice synthesis (ElevenLabs)
- âœ… Word-level subtitle generation (WhisperX)
- âœ… Basic video export (audio with static image)

**Coming Soon**:
- ðŸ”„ Shotlist generation (scene breakdown)
- ðŸ”„ SDXL keyframe generation (high-quality images)
- ðŸ”„ Video synthesis (animated scenes)
- ðŸ”„ Dynamic subtitle overlay
- ðŸ”„ Vision guidance for quality control

### How long does it take to generate a video?

**Current pipeline** (script + voice + subtitles):
- ~3-5 minutes per video (with GPU)
- ~5-10 minutes per video (without GPU)

**Full pipeline** (when complete):
- Estimated ~8-15 minutes per video

Time varies based on:
- Script length
- API response times
- GPU availability
- Model sizes used

## Technical Questions

### What are the system requirements?

**Minimum**:
- Python 3.8+
- 16GB RAM
- 50GB disk space
- Internet connection for APIs

**Recommended**:
- Python 3.10+
- 32GB RAM
- NVIDIA GPU with 16GB VRAM
- 100GB SSD storage
- Fast internet connection

See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for details.

### Do I need a GPU?

**Currently**: No, but recommended for faster subtitle generation (WhisperX).

**Future**: Yes, GPU will be strongly recommended for:
- SDXL image generation
- Video synthesis
- Vision model inference

Without GPU, these stages will be significantly slower or may not work.

### What GPU do I need?

Recommended:
- NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM) or better
- NVIDIA RTX 4080/4090
- NVIDIA A5000/A6000

Minimum for future features:
- NVIDIA RTX 3060 (12GB VRAM)
- NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti (16GB)

AMD GPUs and Apple Silicon support is not currently planned.

### Can I run this on Mac?

**Currently**: Yes, for CPU-based features:
- Script generation (uses OpenAI API)
- Voice synthesis (uses ElevenLabs API)
- Basic audio processing

**Limitations**:
- WhisperX will be slower on CPU
- Future GPU features (SDXL, video synthesis) won't work
- Better to use cloud GPU instances

### Can I run this on Windows?

Yes! The pipeline supports Windows 10/11. Follow the Windows installation steps in [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).

## API and Cost Questions

### What API keys do I need?

**Required**:
1. **OpenAI API key** - for script generation (GPT-4o-mini)
2. **ElevenLabs API key** - for voice synthesis

**Optional** (future):
- HuggingFace token (for some models)

### How much does it cost to generate a video?

**Current costs per video**:

| Service | Usage | Cost |
|---------|-------|------|
| OpenAI GPT-4o-mini | ~800 tokens | ~$0.01 |
| ElevenLabs | ~360 words | ~$0.05-0.15 |
| WhisperX | Local model | Free |
| **Total** | | **~$0.06-0.16** |

**Future costs** (estimated):
- SDXL: Free (local model, uses GPU)
- Video synthesis: Free (local model, uses GPU)
- **Total**: ~$0.06-0.16 per video

Costs vary based on:
- Script length
- Voice quality settings
- Retry/regeneration needs

### Can I use free tiers?

- **OpenAI**: No free tier, but GPT-4o-mini is very affordable
- **ElevenLabs**: Yes! Free tier provides 10,000 characters/month (~28 videos)
- **WhisperX**: Free (open-source, local)

### Are there alternatives to paid APIs?

**For Scripts**:
- Use local LLMs (Llama-3.1, Qwen2.5) - free but needs GPU
- Implementation planned in roadmap

**For Voice**:
- Use Coqui TTS (open-source) - free but lower quality
- Use Microsoft Azure TTS - paid alternative
- Not currently implemented

## Usage Questions

### How do I customize the story style?

Edit the `StoryIdea` parameters:

```python
story = StoryIdea(
    story_title="Your Title",
    narrator_gender="female",  # or "male"
    tone="emotional, dark",    # customize tone
    theme="mystery, betrayal", # main themes
    emotional_core="fear, suspense",
    voice_style="tense, dramatic",
    # ... many more options
)
```

See `examples/custom_story_ideas.py` for examples.

### Can I use my own script instead of AI-generated?

Yes! Place your script in:
```
Stories/1_Scripts/Your_Story_Title/Script.txt
```

Then run from revision stage:
```python
reviser = RevisedScriptGenerator()
reviser.Revise(story_idea)
```

### How do I change the voice?

Edit `Generators/GVoice.py`:

```python
voice=Voice(
    voice_id='BZgkqPqms7Kj9ulSkVzn',  # Change this
    style='Creative'
)
```

Find voice IDs at [ElevenLabs Voice Library](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library).

### Can I generate videos in other languages?

**Currently**: Limited. The pipeline is optimized for English.

**Potential modifications**:
- Change WhisperX language parameter
- Use multilingual voices in ElevenLabs
- Adjust script generation prompts

Full multi-language support is not currently planned but could be added.

### How do I batch process multiple stories?

See `examples/batch_processing.py` for a complete example:

```python
stories = [story1, story2, story3]
for story in stories:
    # Process each story
    process_pipeline(story)
```

## Troubleshooting Questions

### Why is my generation failing?

Common causes:
1. **API keys not configured** - Check `.env` file
2. **CUDA not available** - Check GPU setup
3. **Out of memory** - Close other applications
4. **Network issues** - Check internet connection

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed solutions.

### Why are subtitles misaligned?

Possible causes:
1. **Script doesn't match audio** - Regenerate voiceover
2. **Audio quality issues** - Check normalization
3. **WhisperX model size too small** - Use "large-v2"

### How do I report a bug?

1. Check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
2. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/Nomoos/StoryGenerator/issues)
3. Create new issue with:
   - System info
   - Error message
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
