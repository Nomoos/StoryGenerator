# PrismQ Migration Guide

This guide helps you migrate code from the old `core/` structure to the new `PrismQ/` modular architecture.

## Overview

The repository has been reorganized into independent subprojects under the `PrismQ/` namespace. This provides:
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier maintenance and testing
- Foundation for future modular packaging
- Clear ownership of functionality

## Quick Reference

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Update Imports

**Old Code:**
```python
from core.errors import APIError
from core.pipeline.idea_generation import IdeaAdapter
from core.pipeline.title_scoring import TitleScorer
```

**New Code:**
```python
from PrismQ.Shared.errors import APIError
from PrismQ.IdeaScraper.idea_generation import IdeaAdapter
from PrismQ.StoryTitleScoring.title_scoring import TitleScorer
```

### Step 2: Update Interface Imports

**Old Code:**
```python
from core.interfaces.llm_provider import ILLMProvider
from core.interfaces.platform_provider import PlatformType
```

**New Code:**
```python
from PrismQ.Shared.interfaces.llm_provider import ILLMProvider
from PrismQ.Shared.interfaces.platform_provider import PlatformType
```

### Step 3: Run Tests

After updating imports, run your tests to ensure everything works:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

### Step 4: Update Documentation

Update any documentation that references the old structure.

## Backward Compatibility

During the transition period, the old `core/` imports continue to work through a compatibility layer:

```python
# This still works (redirects to PrismQ automatically)
from core.errors import APIError

# But new code should use:
from PrismQ.Shared.errors import APIError
```

The compatibility layer will be removed in a future release once all code has been migrated.

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Shared Utilities

Anything that multiple subprojects need goes in `PrismQ/Shared/`:
- Error classes
- Configuration
- Logging
- Data models
- Interfaces

### Pattern 2: Subproject-Specific Code

Code specific to a pipeline stage goes in its subproject:
- Idea generation â†’ `PrismQ/IdeaScraper/`
- Title processing â†’ `PrismQ/StoryTitleProcessor/`
- Script development â†’ `PrismQ/StoryGenerator/`
- Audio production â†’ `PrismQ/VoiceOverGenerator/`

### Pattern 3: Cross-Subproject Dependencies

When one subproject needs another, import directly:

```python
# In PrismQ/StoryGenerator/script_development.py
from PrismQ.Shared.interfaces.llm_provider import ILLMProvider
from PrismQ.Shared.errors import ValidationError
```

## Benefits

After migration, you'll get:

1. **Clearer Structure**: Easy to find where functionality lives
2. **Better Testing**: Test subprojects in isolation
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes don't ripple across the codebase
4. **Future Packaging**: Can package subprojects separately if needed
5. **Better Documentation**: Each subproject can have its own docs

## Need Help?

- Check `PrismQ/README.md` for the full structure
- Look at migrated test files in `tests/pipeline/` for examples
- Create an issue if you encounter problems

## Timeline

- âœ… **Phase 1**: Python code migration (complete)
- âœ… **Phase 2**: C# code migration (structure and shared projects complete)
  - âœ… Structure created (19 subproject directories)
  - âœ… Documentation complete
  - âœ… Shared projects created (Core, Models, Interfaces)
- âœ… **Phase 3**: Update all tests to use PrismQ imports (complete - 35 files updated)
