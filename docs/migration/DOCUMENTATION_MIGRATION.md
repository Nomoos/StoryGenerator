# Documentation Migration to PrismQ Structure

**Date**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration of documentation files from the root directory and legacy `core/` directory into the proper PrismQ structure under organized `docs/` subfolders.

## Objectives ✅

1. ✅ Move PrismQ migration-related docs to `docs/migration/`
2. ✅ Move implementation summaries to `docs/implementation/`
3. ✅ Move test/verification docs to `docs/testing/`
4. ✅ Move core documentation to `PrismQ/Shared/docs/`
5. ✅ Update all cross-references
6. ✅ Remove empty `core/` directory
7. ✅ Clean up root directory

---

## Files Migrated

### Migration Documentation → `docs/migration/`

Moved 5 PrismQ migration-related files:
- `PRISMQ_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `PRISMQ_MIGRATION_STATUS.md`
- `PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `PHASE3_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `PHASE4_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

**Total in docs/migration/**: 6 files (including existing PRISMQ_MIGRATION.md)

### Implementation Summaries → `docs/implementation/`

Moved 4 implementation summary files:
- `GROUP_1_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `FACEBOOK_DATABASE_COMPARISON_SUMMARY.md`
- `PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `WORDPRESS_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`

### Test/Verification Documentation → `docs/testing/`

Moved 4 test and verification files:
- `TEST_FIXES_COMPLETE.md`
- `TEST_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`
- `VERIFICATION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`
- `VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`

### Core Documentation → `PrismQ/Shared/docs/`

Moved and renamed 3 files from `core/`:
- `CACHING_GUIDE.md` (unchanged)
- `CONFIG_README.md` → `CONFIG_GUIDE.md` (renamed for consistency)
- `LOGGING_README.md` → `LOGGING_GUIDE.md` (renamed for consistency)

Created new `README.md` to index the guides.

---

## Directory Changes

### Created
- `PrismQ/Shared/docs/` - New directory for shared documentation

### Removed
- `core/` - Empty directory removed completely

### Updated
- `docs/INDEX.md` - Added migration section
- `README.md` - Added link to migration guide

---

## Root Directory Cleanup

**Before Migration**: 18 markdown files at root  
**After Migration**: 5 markdown files at root

### Files Remaining at Root (Appropriate)
- `README.md` - Main project readme
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines  
- `CLEANUP_REPO.md` - Repository maintenance guide
- `MainProgressHub.md` - Main progress tracker
- `POST_ROADMAP_TRACKER.md` - Roadmap tracking

These files are appropriate for the root level as they are primary project documentation.

---

## Cross-References Updated

All references to moved files were updated in:

1. **docs/migration/PHASE3_IMPLEMENTATION.md**
   - Updated path to PRISMQ_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
   - Updated paths to core/ documentation

2. **docs/migration/PHASE4_IMPLEMENTATION.md**
   - Updated path to PRISMQ_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
   - Updated description of core/ directory removal
   - Updated paths to core/ documentation

3. **docs/migration/PRISMQ_MIGRATION_STATUS.md**
   - Updated path to PRISMQ_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
   - Updated paths to core/ documentation

4. **docs/implementation/GROUP_1_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**
   - Updated path to CACHING_GUIDE.md (now in PrismQ/Shared/docs/)

5. **src/CSharp/PrismQ/README.md**
   - Updated path to PRISMQ_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

6. **docs/INDEX.md**
   - Added migration section

7. **README.md**
   - Added link to PrismQ migration guide

---

## File Naming Consistency

Renamed files for consistent naming convention:
- `CONFIG_README.md` → `CONFIG_GUIDE.md`
- `LOGGING_README.md` → `LOGGING_GUIDE.md`

All guide files now use the `*_GUIDE.md` pattern for consistency.

---

## Benefits

### Organization
- ✅ Clear separation of documentation types
- ✅ Migration docs in one place (`docs/migration/`)
- ✅ Implementation summaries organized (`docs/implementation/`)
- ✅ Test docs consolidated (`docs/testing/`)
- ✅ Shared docs with PrismQ modules (`PrismQ/Shared/docs/`)

### Discoverability
- ✅ Easier to find relevant documentation
- ✅ Logical folder structure
- ✅ Clear indexing in docs/INDEX.md
- ✅ Reduced clutter in root directory

### Maintainability
- ✅ Documentation co-located with relevant code
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ All cross-references updated
- ✅ No broken links

---

## Verification

### Test Results ✅
```bash
$ python3 -m pytest tests/pipeline/ -v
============================== 48 passed in 0.40s ==============================
```

All tests pass - no code functionality affected by documentation reorganization.

### Directory Structure ✅

**Root Level (5 files)**:
```
README.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
CLEANUP_REPO.md
MainProgressHub.md
POST_ROADMAP_TRACKER.md
```

**docs/migration/ (6 files)**:
```
PRISMQ_MIGRATION.md
