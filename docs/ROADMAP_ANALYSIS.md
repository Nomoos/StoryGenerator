# Hybrid Architecture Roadmap: Current Status and Next Steps

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025  
**Status:** Active Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

The StoryGenerator project uses a **hybrid C# + Python** architecture – C# handles orchestration, APIs and I/O, while Python does the heavy ML inference (ASR, image/video models). The hybrid roadmap tracks 85 implementation tasks across all pipeline stages. To date, roughly 15 tasks (~18%) are complete, covering the **foundation** work and core generators, and about 5 tasks (the C# orchestration "pipeline foundation") are in progress. The remaining 65 tasks (the **content pipeline** and advanced features) are marked as *Not Started* backlog items.

**Key Points:**
- **Architecture:** Hybrid C# (.NET 9.0) for orchestration + Python for ML inference
- **Total Tasks:** 85 (15 completed, 5 in progress, 65 not started)
- **Current Phase:** Pipeline orchestration infrastructure (Stage 8)
- **Next Priority:** High-priority content generation features (Stages 3, 5, 6)

## Completed & In-Progress Pipeline Components

The pipeline's initial stages are already implemented. For example, the system currently provides: story idea generation, AI script generation, script revision, ElevenLabs voice synthesis, WhisperX subtitle alignment, and basic video export. These correspond to stages 1–7 of the pipeline. In particular, the "Video Export & Metadata" step (Stage 7) is done; only the final touch-ups (like dynamic subtitle overlay) remain.

### Completed Components (Phase 1: 15 tasks)

**Foundation & Core Infrastructure:**
- ✅ StoryIdea Model - Core data model with viral potential scoring
- ✅ FileHelper & PathConfiguration - File I/O and path management
- ✅ PerformanceMonitor - Operation timing and metrics tracking
- ✅ RetryService - Polly-based resilience patterns

**API Providers:**
- ✅ OpenAI Provider - GPT-4 integration for text generation
- ✅ ElevenLabs Provider - Professional voice synthesis

**Content Generators:**
- ✅ IdeaGenerator - Story idea generation with viral scoring
- ✅ ScriptGenerator - Script generation (~360 words)
- ✅ RevisionGenerator - Script revision for voice clarity
- ✅ EnhancementGenerator - ElevenLabs voice tag enhancement

- ✅ SubtitleGenerator - Subtitle generation and formatting

**Data & Content:**
- ✅ SQLite Database - Local data persistence
- ✅ Content Collectors - Reddit/Instagram/TikTok content sourcing
- ✅ Job System - Background job processing for content collection

### In-Progress Components (Phase 2: 5 tasks)

The roadmap shows **pipeline orchestration infrastructure** (Stage 8) is actively in progress – this is the "One-Click integration" work to automate and monitor the end-to-end workflow. In sum, key C# providers and core Python generators are in place, and focus has shifted to wiring them together.

## Next Steps and Recommendations

### 1. Finish Orchestration Foundation (Pipeline Integration)

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** In Progress

Continue the current work on the pipeline orchestration (Stage 8). Completing the C# "one-click integration" glue code will enable automatic end-to-end runs, monitoring, and recovery. This infrastructure makes it easier to plug in subsequent stages.

**Action Items:**
- Complete `IPipelineStage` interface implementation
- Finish checkpoint manager for resume capability
- Set up configuration system for stage control
- Implement structured logging and monitoring
- Test error handling and resilience patterns

### 2. Tackle High-Priority Content Tasks

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Not Started (Planned)

Once the orchestration basics are in place, move on to the high-priority content-generation features. In particular, start with **Shotlist generation** and **Video synthesis**, since they are critical for turning scripts into visuals. These can be developed initially as prototypes or research spikes to validate the approach.

**Recommended Order:**
1. **Shotlist Generation (Stage 3)** - Build scene planning capability
   - Start with a prototype to parse scripts into scenes
   - Validate the approach before full implementation
   - Enables visual storyboard planning

2. **SDXL Keyframe Generation (Stage 5)** - Add visual content creation
   - Prototype feeding generated shotlists into SDXL
   - Test image quality and generation parameters
   - Critical for creating reference images

3. **Video Synthesis (Stage 6)** - Enable animation
   - Prototype feeding keyframes into video generator (LTX/SVD)
   - Validate video quality and synthesis parameters
   - Completes the visual pipeline

4. **Dynamic Subtitle Overlay (Stage 7)** - Final post-production
   - Add stylized subtitle rendering
   - Implement audio-visual synchronization
   - Polish the final output

**Development Approach:**
- Build small prototypes or research spikes first
- Validate approach and refine requirements
- Then proceed to full implementation
- Test each stage independently before integration

### 3. Use the Hybrid C#/Python Approach

**Principle:** Maintain architectural consistency

As always, implement orchestration and I/O in C# (for performance and control) and use Python for model inference. The existing pattern (C# pipelines invoking Python scripts like `GVoice.py` or `GVideoCompositor.py`) should continue for new generators. This division of labor is already established as optimal.

**Pattern for New Stages:**
```csharp
// C# Side - Orchestration
public class KeyframeGenerator : IKeyframeGenerator
{
    private readonly IPythonScriptExecutor _executor;

    public async Task<List<string>> GenerateKeyframesAsync(
        List<string> prompts,
        string outputDir,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        var args = new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            ["prompts"] = prompts,
            ["output_dir"] = outputDir,
            ["model"] = "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0"
        };

        var result = await _executor.ExecuteAsync<KeyframeResult>(
            "scripts/sdxl_generate.py",
            args,
            cancellationToken
        );

        return result.ImagePaths;
    }
}
```

```python
# Python Side - ML Inference
import json
import sys
from diffusers import StableDiffusionXLPipeline

def main():
    # Parse input from C#
    with open(sys.argv[1]) as f:
        args = json.load(f)
    
    # Load model and generate images
    pipe = StableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_pretrained(args["model"])
    images = pipe(args["prompts"]).images
    
    # Save and return results
    result = {"image_paths": save_images(images, args["output_dir"])}
    print(json.dumps(result))
```

### 4. Maintain the Backlog Organization

**Principle:** Keep visibility and prioritization clear

Leave the remaining *Not Started* tasks in the backlog until ready to work on them. In other words, **do not remove or delete them** – the roadmap is intended to track all tasks. This ensures visibility and prioritization.

**Backlog Management:**
- Keep all 65 not-started tasks catalogued as planned
- Break large backlog items into sub-issues or milestones as needed
- Tasks stay in "Planned" category until actively scheduled
- Use the issues/labels system for detailed tracking
- Update status as work begins on each task

### 5. Iterate and Review

**Principle:** Keep the roadmap realistic and up-to-date

As features are prototyped and implemented, update the roadmap/status table. For example, once shotlist generation is underway, change its status to "In Progress" and estimate completion. This keeps the hybrid roadmap realistic.

**Review Process:**
- Update roadmap as tasks move from "Not Started" to "In Progress"
- Track actual effort vs. estimated effort
- Adjust timelines based on velocity metrics
- Document lessons learned and best practices
- Use the existing roadmap and issues/labels system for phase-based planning
