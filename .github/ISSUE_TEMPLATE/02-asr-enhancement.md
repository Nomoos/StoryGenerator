## 📋 Component Information

**Component**: ASR Module  
**Stage**: 2 of 10  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 week

## 🎯 Overview

Enhance the existing WhisperX-based ASR module to use faster-whisper large-v3 for improved transcription speed and accuracy.

## 📊 Current Implementation

- **File**: `Generators/GTitles.py`
- **Model**: WhisperX large-v2
- **Features**: Word-level alignment, SRT generation

## ✅ Requirements

### Must Have
- [ ] Upgrade to faster-whisper large-v3
- [ ] Maintain word-level timestamp accuracy
- [ ] Preserve SRT export functionality
- [ ] Keep script-to-audio alignment

### Should Have
- [ ] Multi-language detection
- [ ] Confidence scoring per word
- [ ] Quality metrics (WER)
- [ ] Batch processing optimization

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Speaker diarization
- [ ] Background noise detection
- [ ] Auto quality adjustment

## 📝 Subtasks

### 1. Model Integration
- [ ] Install faster-whisper library
- [ ] Test faster-whisper large-v3 performance
- [ ] Compare accuracy with WhisperX large-v2
- [ ] Benchmark speed improvement

### 2. Core Functionality
- [ ] Adapt alignment algorithm for faster-whisper
- [ ] Preserve word-level timestamps
- [ ] Maintain SRT export format
- [ ] Test with existing audio files

### 3. Enhancements
- [ ] Add language detection
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring
- [ ] Add WER calculation
- [ ] Optimize batch processing

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Test with various audio qualities
- [ ] Test with different accents
- [ ] Verify timestamp accuracy (±50ms)
- [ ] Stress test with long audio files (>10 min)

## 🎯 Performance Targets
- Transcription speed: >5x real-time
- Word-level accuracy: >95%
- Timestamp precision: ±50ms
- VRAM usage: <6GB

## 📁 Files to Create/Modify

**Modified Files:**
- `Generators/GTitles.py`
- `requirements.txt`

**New Files (Optional):**
- `Generators/GASR.py` (dedicated ASR module)
- `tests/test_asr.py`

## ✨ Success Criteria
- [ ] Transcription is faster than current implementation
- [ ] Accuracy is equal or better
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Word-level alignment works correctly
