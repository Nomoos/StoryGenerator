## üìã Component Information

**Component**: Pipeline Integration & Automation  
**Stage**: 8 of 10  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks

## üéØ Overview

Create a unified, one-click pipeline that orchestrates all stages from story idea to final video, with robust error handling, checkpointing, and progress tracking.

## üìä Current State

- ‚úÖ Individual stage implementations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual execution required
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No error recovery
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No progress persistence

## ‚úÖ Requirements

### Must Have
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline orchestration
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Checkpoint/resume functionality
- [ ] Progress tracking and logging
- [ ] Configuration management

### Should Have
- [ ] Parallel stage execution (where possible)
- [ ] Resource monitoring (GPU, RAM)
- [ ] Stage skipping/selection
- [ ] Dry-run mode
- [ ] Performance profiling

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Web UI for monitoring
- [ ] Slack/Discord notifications
- [ ] Cloud deployment support
- [ ] Multi-video batch processing

## üìù Subtasks

### 1. Pipeline Orchestrator
- [ ] Create main orchestrator class
- [ ] Implement stage execution engine
- [ ] Add dependency resolution
- [ ] Handle stage transitions

### 2. Error Handling
- [ ] Implement try-catch per stage
- [ ] Add retry logic with backoff
- [ ] Create error reporting
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation

### 3. Checkpointing
- [ ] Design checkpoint format
- [ ] Save state after each stage
- [ ] Implement resume functionality
- [ ] Clean up old checkpoints

### 4. Progress Tracking
- [ ] Create progress reporter
- [ ] Add percentage completion
- [ ] Estimate remaining time
- [ ] Log to file and console

### 5. Configuration System
- [ ] Consolidate all configs
- [ ] Add configuration validation
- [ ] Support multiple profiles
- [ ] Document all options

### 6. Resource Management
- [ ] Monitor GPU memory
- [ ] Track RAM usage
- [ ] Implement model caching
- [ ] Add cleanup routines

### 7. CLI Interface
- [ ] Create command-line tool
- [ ] Add argument parsing
- [ ] Implement help system
- [ ] Add verbose/quiet modes

### 8. Testing
- [ ] Test full pipeline end-to-end
- [ ] Test error recovery
- [ ] Test checkpoint resume
- [ ] Stress test with multiple runs

## üéØ Performance Targets
- Full pipeline: <30 minutes (excluding video generation)
- Checkpoint overhead: <2 seconds per stage
- Memory overhead: <500MB
- Error recovery: 100% (no data loss)

## üìÅ Files to Create/Modify

**New Files:**
- `pipeline_orchestrator.py`
- `pipeline_config.yaml`
- `checkpoint_manager.py`
- `progress_tracker.py`
- `cli.py`
- `tests/test_pipeline.py`

**Modified Files:**
- All generator files (add consistent interfaces)
- `requirements.txt`

## üé¨ Pipeline Stages Flow

```
1. Story Idea ‚Üí 2. Script ‚Üí 3. Revise ‚Üí 4. Voice ‚Üí 5. ASR ‚Üí 
6. Shotlist ‚Üí 7. [Vision] ‚Üí 8. Keyframes ‚Üí 9. Video ‚Üí 10. Post
```

## ‚ú® Success Criteria
- [ ] One command runs entire pipeline
- [ ] Pipeline recovers from errors
- [ ] Can resume from any stage
- [ ] Progress is clearly tracked
- [ ] Configuration is centralized

## üîó Dependencies
- All previous stages (1-7)
