00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
When I was 12, I found
a letter in my dad's drawer

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,000
It was from my mom
who passed away when I was born

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,800
She wrote it before she died,
knowing she wouldn't make it

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,500
"My darling, I'm so sorry
I won't be there for you"

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,200
"But promise me you'll live
the life I couldn't"

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,800
"Dance in the rain,
laugh until you cry"

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,500
"And always remember,
you were loved"

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,200
I cried for hours holding that letter

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,000
Now it's framed next to my bed,
reminding me every day

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,500
That even in death,
a mother's love never fades
