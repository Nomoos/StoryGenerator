# Group 1: Foundation & Infrastructure

**Focus Areas:**
- Core pipeline orchestration
- Configuration management
- Error handling and retry logic
- Performance monitoring
- Cross-cutting infrastructure concerns

**Independence Level:** ‚úÖ **Highly Independent** - Provides foundational services used by all groups but doesn't depend on pipeline content

## üìã Current Status

**Quick Status:** 9 tasks available (37-55 hours) | ‚úÖ Basic infrastructure complete (Oct 9, 2025)

See detailed status tracking:
- **[GROUP_1_STATUS.md](GROUP_1_STATUS.md)** - Comprehensive progress hub and task list
- **[.NEXT.MD](.NEXT.MD)** - Current priority and execution order
- **[.ISSUES/](.ISSUES/)** - Open issues (9 tasks)
- **[.DONE/](.DONE/)** - Completed issues

## üîÑ Workflow

1. **Pick a task** from `.ISSUES/` or create a new one
2. **Update `.NEXT.MD`** to reflect your current focus
3. **Work on the task** following TDD principles
4. **Update progress** in the child issue file
5. **Complete and move** from `.ISSUES/` to `.DONE/` when finished
6. **Sync roadmap** - Update HYBRID_ROADMAP.md with status changes
