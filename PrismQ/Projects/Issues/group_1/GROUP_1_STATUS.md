## Blockers/Risks

### Current Blockers
**None** - All tasks are independent and ready to start

### Potential Risks

#### üü° Medium Risk
- **Refactoring Impact:** Architecture decoupling may require updates to existing code across multiple modules
  - *Mitigation:* Start with interface definitions, then refactor incrementally with comprehensive tests

- **Testing Coordination:** Testing infrastructure needs coordination with CI/CD setup
  - *Mitigation:* Define clear testing standards early, integrate with GitHub Actions gradually

- **Cache Backend Decision:** Caching implementation requires choice between Redis vs file-based
  - *Mitigation:* Start with file-based cache (simpler), provide Redis as optional upgrade

#### üü¢ Low Risk
- **Code Style Enforcement:** Initial formatting may generate large diffs
  - *Mitigation:* Apply formatting in dedicated commit, exclude from blame with .git-blame-ignore-revs

- **Configuration Migration:** Existing configs may need migration to new system
  - *Mitigation:* Support both old and new formats during transition period

## Execution Strategy

### Recommended Order

**Phase 1: Infrastructure (Week 1)**
1. infrastructure-testing (6-8h)
2. infrastructure-configuration (4-6h)
3. infrastructure-logging (3-5h)

**Phase 2: Architecture (Week 2)**
4. architecture-decoupling (6-8h)
5. architecture-openai-api (4-6h)

**Phase 3: Code Quality (Week 3)**
6. code-quality-input-validation (3-5h)
7. code-quality-error-handling (4-6h)
8. code-quality-code-style (2-4h)

**Phase 4: Performance (Week 4)**
9. performance-caching (5-7h)

### Parallelization Options

Tasks within each phase can be worked in parallel:
- **2 developers:** Phase 1 in 2-3 days, Phase 2 in 2-3 days, Phase 3 in 2-3 days
- **3 developers:** All infrastructure tasks simultaneously (1 week for entire group)

### Dependencies

```
infrastructure-testing ‚îÄ‚îê
                        ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí architecture-decoupling ‚îÄ‚îê
infrastructure-config ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§                            ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí code-quality-* ‚îÄ‚Üí performance-caching
                        ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí architecture-openai-api ‚îÄ‚îò
infrastructure-logging ‚îÄ‚îò
```

Most tasks are independent. Architecture tasks benefit from infrastructure completion. Code quality tasks benefit from architecture improvements.
