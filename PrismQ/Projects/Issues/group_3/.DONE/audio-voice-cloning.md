# Audio Production: Voice Cloning System

**Group:** group_3  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 hours  
**Actual Effort:** ~8 hours  
**Completed:** 2025-10-10  

## Description

Implement voice cloning system to create custom voices for different audience segments. Use Coqui TTS or similar for voice cloning from reference audio samples.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Voice cloning from reference samples (5-10 minutes of audio)
- [x] Multiple voice profiles per age/gender segment
- [x] Voice quality validation
- [x] Voice embedding storage and reuse
- [x] TTS generation with cloned voices
- [x] A/B testing framework for voice variants
- [x] Unit tests with sample voices

## Dependencies

- Install: `TTS>=0.20.0` (Coqui TTS)
- Requires: Audio production infrastructure from Group 3
- Requires: CUDA/GPU for training (recommended)

## Implementation Notes

Create `core/PrismQ/Pipeline/voice_cloning.py`:

```python
from TTS.api import TTS
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, List

class VoiceCloner:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str = "tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v2"):
        self.tts = TTS(model_name)
        self.voice_profiles = {}
    
    def clone_voice(self, 
                   reference_audio: Path, 
                   voice_name: str,
                   target_gender: str,
                   target_age: str) -> Dict:
        """Clone voice from reference audio"""
        
        # Extract voice embedding
        embedding = self.tts.synthesizer.compute_speaker_embedding(
            str(reference_audio)
        )
        
        # Store voice profile
        profile = {
            "name": voice_name,
            "embedding": embedding.tolist(),
            "target_gender": target_gender,
            "target_age": target_age,
            "reference_audio": str(reference_audio)
        }
        
        self.voice_profiles[voice_name] = profile
        return profile
    
    def synthesize_with_voice(self, 
                             text: str, 
                             voice_name: str,
                             output_path: Path) -> Path:
        """Generate speech with cloned voice"""
        
        if voice_name not in self.voice_profiles:
            raise ValueError(f"Voice profile '{voice_name}' not found")
        
        profile = self.voice_profiles[voice_name]
        
        # Generate with cloned voice
        self.tts.tts_to_file(
            text=text,
            speaker_embedding=profile["embedding"],
            file_path=str(output_path)
        )
        
        return output_path
    
    def save_voice_profiles(self, output_dir: Path):
        """Save all voice profiles to disk"""
        import json
        
        for name, profile in self.voice_profiles.items():
            profile_path = output_dir / f"{name}_profile.json"
            with open(profile_path, 'w') as f:
                json.dump(profile, f, indent=2)
```

## Output Files

**Directory:** `data/voices/cloned/{gender}/{age_bucket}/`
**Files:**
- `{voice_name}_profile.json` - Voice embedding and metadata
- `{voice_name}_sample.wav` - Sample generation for quality check
