# Pipeline Modular Restructuring - Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- [x] Created `IPipelineStage` base interface (`Infrastructure/Core/Shared/interfaces/pipeline_stage.py`)
- [x] Created `BasePipelineStage` with common functionality
- [x] Created `StageResult`, `StageMetadata`, `StageStatus` for execution tracking

### 2. Stage Contracts
- [x] Created input/output contracts for all 5 stages (`Infrastructure/Core/Shared/interfaces/stage_contracts.py`):
  - Stage 01: `IdeaGenerationInput`, `IdeaGenerationOutput`, `IdeaItem`
  - Stage 02: `TextGenerationInput`, `TextGenerationOutput`, `TextContent`
  - Stage 03: `AudioGenerationInput`, `AudioGenerationOutput`, `AudioContent`, `SubtitleSegment`
  - Stage 04: `ImageGenerationInput`, `ImageGenerationOutput`, `KeyFrame`
  - Stage 05: `VideoGenerationInput`, `VideoGenerationOutput`, `VideoContent`

### 3. Documentation
- [x] Created `Pipeline/MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture overview
- [x] Created `Pipeline/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step migration guide
- [x] Created README for each stage:
  - [x] `Pipeline/01_IdeaGeneration/README.md`
  - [x] `Pipeline/02_TextGeneration/README.md`
  - [x] `Pipeline/03_AudioGeneration/README.md`
  - [x] `Pipeline/04_ImageGeneration/README.md`
  - [x] `Pipeline/05_VideoGeneration/README.md`

### 4. Examples
- [x] Created `Development/Examples/stage_01_idea_generation.py` - Full stage implementation example
- [x] Created `Development/Examples/pipeline_orchestrator.py` - Pipeline chaining example with mock stages

### 5. Testing
- [x] Created `Development/Tests/pipeline/test_stage_contracts.py` - Tests for all contracts
- [x] Verified contracts are importable and functional
- [x] Verified pipeline orchestrator works correctly

## 📋 What This Enables

### Independence
Each stage is now **fully independent**:
- ✅ Has clear input/output contracts (typed data classes)
- ✅ Only depends on shared infrastructure interfaces
- ✅ Can be tested without other stages
- ✅ Can be developed in isolation
- ✅ Can be versioned independently
- ✅ Can eventually be moved to separate repositories

### No Cross-Dependencies
- ✅ Stages only import from `Infrastructure/Core/Shared/interfaces`
- ✅ No imports between pipeline stages
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Prevents circular dependencies

### Testability
- ✅ Each stage can be tested with mocked dependencies
- ✅ Input validation is explicit
- ✅ Output format is guaranteed by contract
- ✅ Execution metadata is tracked

## 🔄 Current State vs Target State

### Current Implementation (Existing Code)
The existing code in `Pipeline/01_IdeaGeneration/IdeaScraper/scripts/generate_ideas.py` still has:
```python
# Cross-stage imports (to be removed)
from PrismQ.IdeaScraper.idea_generation import IdeaAdapter, IdeaGenerator
from PrismQ.StoryTitleProcessor.title_generation import TitleGenerator  # ❌
from PrismQ.VoiceOverGenerator.voice_recommendation import VoiceRecommender  # ❌
```

### Target Implementation (New Architecture)
The new architecture uses:
```python
# Only contract imports (correct)
from PrismQ.Infrastructure.Core.Shared.interfaces import (
    IdeaGenerationInput,
    IdeaGenerationOutput,
    TextGenerationInput,
    IPipelineStage,
)

# Stages communicate through contracts, not direct calls
idea_result = await idea_stage.execute(idea_input)
text_input = TextGenerationInput(idea=idea_result.data.ideas[0])
text_result = await text_stage.execute(text_input)
```

## 📊 Migration Progress

### Infrastructure ✅ 100% Complete
- [x] Base interfaces defined
- [x] Stage contracts created
- [x] Documentation written
- [x] Examples provided
- [x] Tests added

### Stage Implementations ⏳ 0% Migrated
The existing stage implementations need to be refactored:

- [ ] Stage 01: IdeaGeneration
  - [ ] Create `stage.py` implementing `IPipelineStage`
  - [ ] Remove cross-imports from scripts
  - [ ] Update tests to use contracts
  
- [ ] Stage 02: TextGeneration
  - [ ] Create `stage.py` implementing `IPipelineStage`
  - [ ] Consolidate sub-modules (StoryTitleProcessor, StoryTitleScoring, etc.)
  - [ ] Update tests to use contracts
  
- [ ] Stage 03: AudioGeneration
  - [ ] Create `stage.py` implementing `IPipelineStage`
  - [ ] Consolidate VoiceOverGenerator and SubtitleGenerator
  - [ ] Update tests to use contracts
  
- [ ] Stage 04: ImageGeneration
  - [ ] Create `stage.py` implementing `IPipelineStage`
  - [ ] Update tests to use contracts
  
- [ ] Stage 05: VideoGeneration
  - [ ] Create `stage.py` implementing `IPipelineStage`
  - [ ] Consolidate VideoGenerator and FrameInterpolation
  - [ ] Update tests to use contracts

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Phase 1: Demonstrate the Architecture (✅ DONE)
This PR demonstrates the modular architecture with:
1. Complete interface definitions
2. Full documentation
3. Working examples
4. Test infrastructure

### Phase 2: Migrate Existing Code (Future)
To fully adopt the architecture:
1. Refactor each stage to implement `IPipelineStage`
2. Remove all cross-stage imports
3. Update existing scripts to use orchestration
4. Migrate tests to use contracts

### Phase 3: Separate Repositories (Future)
Once migration is complete:
1. Extract `Infrastructure/Core/Shared/interfaces` to `prismq-core` package
2. Move each stage to its own repository
3. Publish as separate packages
4. Use semantic versioning for compatibility
