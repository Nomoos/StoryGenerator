# StoryGenerator - Folder Structure Documentation

This document describes the complete folder structure for organizing artifacts and project outputs in the StoryGenerator project.

## Overview

The folder structure is designed to organize content by:
- **Gender**: `women` or `men`
- **Age Buckets**: `10-13`, `14-17`, `18-23`, `24-30`

This organization allows for targeted content generation and management based on audience demographics.

## Folder Structure

### Configuration
- **/config/** - Configuration files for the project

### Content Generation Pipeline

#### 1. Ideas & Topics
- **/ideas/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - Story ideas organized by target audience
- **/topics/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - Topic classifications and categories

#### 2. Script Generation
- **/data/raw_local/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - Initial raw scripts generated locally
- **/data/iter_local/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - Iteratively refined scripts
- **/data/gpt_improved/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - GPT-enhanced/improved scripts

#### 3. Scoring & Titles
- **/scores/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - Quality scores and metrics for generated content
- **/titles/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - Video titles and metadata

#### 4. Voice & Audio
- **/voices/choice/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - Voice selection and configuration
- **/audio/tts/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - Text-to-speech generated audio
- **/audio/normalized/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - Normalized audio files

#### 5. Subtitles & Scenes
- **/subtitles/srt/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - SRT subtitle files
- **/subtitles/timed/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - Timed subtitle data
- **/scenes/json/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - Scene descriptions in JSON format

#### 6. Visual Assets
- **/images/keyframes_v1/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - First version of keyframe images
- **/images/keyframes_v2/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - Second version of keyframe images

#### 7. Video Generation
- **/videos/ltx/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - LTX video files
- **/videos/interp/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - Interpolated video files

#### 8. Final Output
- **/final/{gender}/{age-bucket}/** - Final processed videos ready for distribution

### Research & Development
- **/research/python/** - Python research scripts and experiments
- **/research/csharp/** - C# research scripts and experiments

## Age Buckets

The default age buckets covering ages 10-30 are:
- **10-13**: Pre-teen audience
- **14-17**: Teenage audience
- **18-23**: Young adult audience
- **24-30**: Adult audience

These buckets help ensure age-appropriate content generation and targeting.

## Gender Categories

Content is organized by two gender categories:
- **women**: Content targeted at female audiences
- **men**: Content targeted at male audiences

## Usage

### Setting Up the Folder Structure

Run the setup script to create all necessary folders:

```bash
python setup_folders.py
```

This will create all 147 folder structures with `.gitkeep` files to preserve empty directories in git.

### Accessing Folders in Code

Example Python code to access the folder structure:

```python
from pathlib import Path

# Define root directory
ROOT_DIR = Path(__file__).parent

# Access specific folders
ideas_women_teen = ROOT_DIR / "ideas" / "women" / "14-17"
scripts_men_young = ROOT_DIR / "scripts" / "gpt_improved" / "men" / "18-23"
final_women_preteen = ROOT_DIR / "final" / "women" / "10-13"

# List all age buckets for a specific category
age_buckets = ["10-13", "14-17", "18-23", "24-30"]
genders = ["women", "men"]

for gender in genders:
    for age_bucket in age_buckets:
        path = ROOT_DIR / "ideas" / gender / age_bucket
        print(f"Processing: {path}")
```

## Migration from Old Structure

The previous folder structure used numbered directories (0_Ideas, 1_Scripts, etc.) in the `Stories/` directory. The new structure provides more granular organization with:

1. **Demographic targeting** through gender and age bucket subdirectories
2. **Pipeline stage clarity** with descriptive folder names
3. **Version management** for iterative improvements (raw_local, iter_local, gpt_improved)
4. **Asset separation** with dedicated folders for different file types

## Maintenance

- Each leaf directory contains a `.gitkeep` file to preserve the structure in git
- Empty folders are tracked to ensure consistent structure across all environments
- Run `setup_folders.py` on new clones to ensure the complete structure exists

## Summary

Total folder count: **147 folders**
- Simple folders: **1** (config)
- Folders with gender/age buckets: **144** (18 categories × 2 genders × 4 age buckets)
- Research folders: **2** (python, csharp)

This structure provides a comprehensive organization system for all artifacts and outputs generated by the StoryGenerator pipeline.
