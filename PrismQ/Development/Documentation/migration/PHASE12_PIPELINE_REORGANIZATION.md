# Phase 12: Pipeline-Based Reorganization

**Date**: 2025-10-11  
**Issue**: Reorganize structure to follow pipeline flow from start to end

## Summary

Reorganized the entire PrismQ structure to follow a logical pipeline flow from idea generation to final video production. The new structure groups modules by their stage in the content creation pipeline.

## Pipeline Flow

The new organization follows the natural content creation workflow:

**Idea → Text → Audio → Images → Video**

## Changes Made

### 1. Pipeline Stages (Sequential)

Created numbered pipeline stages for clear workflow:

**01_IdeaGeneration**
- IdeaScraper (from Content/)

**02_TextGeneration**
- StoryGenerator (from Content/)
- StoryTitleProcessor (from Content/)
- StoryTitleScoring (from Content/)
- StoryTitleFineTune (from Content/)
- SceneDescriptions (from Content/)
- DescriptionGenerator (from Content/)
- TagsGenerator (from Content/)
- StoryDescriptionScoring (from Content/)
- StoryDescriptionFineTune (from Content/)
- FinalizeText (from Media/)

**03_AudioGeneration**
- VoiceOverGenerator (from Media/)
- SubtitleGenerator (from Media/)
- FinalizeAudio (from Media/)

**04_ImageGeneration**
- SparseKeyFramesGenerator (from Media/)

**05_VideoGeneration**
- VideoGenerator (from Media/)
- FrameInterpolation (from Media/)
- FinalizeVideo (from Media/)

### 2. Infrastructure Group

Organized core services:
- Core/ - Shared utilities and configuration
- Platform/ - External service integrations
- Utilities/ - Tools, scripts, and automation

### 3. Resources Group

Organized project resources:
- Assets/ - Static media assets
- Data/ - Runtime data
- Configuration/ - Configuration files

### 4. Development Group

Organized development resources:
- Tests/ - Test suite
- Examples/ - Usage examples
- Documentation/ - Project documentation

### 5. Projects Group

Organized related projects:
- CSharp/ - C# implementation
- Research/ - Research documents
- Issues/ - Issue tracking
- Podcasts/ - Podcast content

## Final Structure

## Import Pattern Changes

### Before (Phase 11)
```python
from PrismQ.Content.IdeaScraper.idea_generation import IdeaGenerator
from PrismQ.Media.VoiceOverGenerator import VoiceRecommender
from PrismQ.Core.Shared.config import settings
```

### After (Phase 12 - Pipeline-Based)
```python
from PrismQ.Pipeline.01_IdeaGeneration.IdeaScraper.idea_generation import IdeaGenerator
from PrismQ.Pipeline.03_AudioGeneration.VoiceOverGenerator import VoiceRecommender
from PrismQ.Infrastructure.Core.Shared.config import settings
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Pipeline Flow**: Numbered stages show exact order of operations
2. **Logical Grouping**: Modules grouped by pipeline stage
3. **Easy Navigation**: Clear progression from idea to video
4. **Modular Design**: Each stage is independent and testable
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add new stages or modules
6. **Better Organization**: Infrastructure, resources, and development clearly separated

## Verification

✅ All modules organized by pipeline stage  
✅ Infrastructure properly separated  
✅ Resources grouped together  
✅ Development tools organized  
✅ Projects maintained separately  
✅ Documentation updated  
✅ __init__.py files created for all groups

- [Root README](../../../README.md) - Repository overview

## Conclusion

The repository now follows a clear pipeline-based structure that reflects the actual content creation workflow. Each stage is numbered and organized sequentially, making it easy to understand the flow from idea generation to final video production.
