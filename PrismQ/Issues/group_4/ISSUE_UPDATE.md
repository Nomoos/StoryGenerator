# Group 4 ‚Äî Progress & Coordination Hub

This issue tracks all unfinished tasks, current priorities, and blockers for **Group 4** development in StoryGenerator. Maintainers should update this issue with:
- The current priority from `issues/group_4/.NEXT.MD`
- Unfinished tasks from `issues/group_4/.ISSUES/`
- Blockers, risks, and links to roadmaps or child issues

---

## üìÖ Update Checklist
- [x] `.NEXT.MD` is up to date
- [x] Unfinished tasks listed below
- [x] Blockers/risks noted
- [x] Roadmap synced

## Current Focus (`.NEXT.MD`)

**Task:** Video Production - Variant Selection  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Status:** üìã Not Started  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours  
**Issue File:** `issues/group_4/.ISSUES/10-video-03-variant-selection.md`

### Description
Implement video variant selection system that analyzes generated videos and selects the best variant based on quality metrics, visual coherence, and motion smoothness. This is the first step in the Assembly/Distribution pipeline.

### Progress
- [ ] Video quality scoring algorithm implemented
- [ ] Variant comparison and selection logic
- [ ] Quality metrics calculation (sharpness, stability, coherence)
- [ ] Metadata tracking for each variant
- [ ] Selected variant output with justification
- [ ] Unit tests for selection logic

---

## Unfinished Tasks

**Total:** 3 tasks, **19-24 hours** estimated effort

### Task Execution Order
Due to dependencies, tasks must be completed sequentially:

1. **Video Variant Selection** ‚Üí 2. **Quality Control** ‚Üí 3. **Distribution**

### 1. Video Production - Variant Selection ‚≠ê CURRENT PRIORITY
- **File:** `issues/group_4/.ISSUES/10-video-03-variant-selection.md`
- **Priority:** P1 (High)
- **Status:** üìã Not Started
- **Effort:** 3-4 hours
- **Dependencies:** Requires video production output from Group 3
- **Blocks:** Tasks 2 & 3

### 2. Quality Control - Automated Video QC System
- **File:** `issues/group_4/.ISSUES/quality-control-automated.md`
- **Priority:** P1 (High)
- **Status:** ‚è≥ Waiting (Blocked by Task 1)
- **Effort:** 6-8 hours
- **Dependencies:** Requires selected videos from Task 1
- **Blocks:** Task 3

### 3. Distribution - Multi-Platform Publisher
- **File:** `issues/group_4/.ISSUES/distribution-multi-platform.md`
- **Priority:** P2 (Medium)
- **Status:** ‚è≥ Waiting (Blocked by Tasks 1 & 2)
- **Effort:** 10-12 hours
- **Dependencies:** Requires QC-passed videos from Task 2
- **Blocks:** None (terminal task)

---

## Blockers/Risks

### Current Blockers
- **Task 1:** None - Ready to start (waiting for video production output from Group 3)
- **Task 2:** Blocked by Task 1 completion
- **Task 3:** Blocked by Task 1 & 2 completion

### Potential Risks
1. **Video Production Dependency** - Tasks depend on Group 3 completing video production
2. **API Credentials Required** - Task 3 requires platform API credentials (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook)
3. **Package Dependencies** - Multiple Python packages needed: `opencv-python`, `scikit-image`, `ffmpeg-python`, `google-api-python-client`, `instagrapi`
4. **Platform API Changes** - Social media APIs may change, requiring updates
5. **Quality Standards Tuning** - QC thresholds may need adjustment based on actual video quality

### Mitigation Strategies
- Coordinate with Group 3 for video production timeline
- Set up platform API credentials early
- Install and test required packages before implementation
- Build flexible configuration for QC thresholds
- Use latest API client libraries with good maintenance

---

## Timeline Estimate

**Week 1:**
- Days 1-2: Task 1 - Video Variant Selection (3-4h)
- Days 2-4: Task 2 - Quality Control System (6-8h)

**Week 2:**
- Days 5-7: Task 3 - Multi-Platform Distribution (10-12h)

**Total:** 7 working days, 19-24 hours of development effort
