Write a compelling, emotional story that hooks viewers in the first 3 seconds...
Target length: ~360 words (~60 seconds of speech)
```

**User Prompt**:
```
Write a story with these parameters:
- Title: The Unexpected Friend
- Tone: emotional, heartwarming
- Theme: friendship, acceptance
- Narrator: first-person female
...
```

### Output: Initial Script

**File**: `Stories/1_Scripts/The_Unexpected_Friend/script.txt`

```
I always ate lunch alone. Not because I wanted to, but because that's just how it was. 
Until the day everything changed.

It was a Tuesday, I remember because it was pizza dayâ€”my one bright spot in the week. 
I grabbed my tray and headed to my usual corner table in the cafeteria. That's when I 
noticed her. The new girl. She was standing there, looking just as lost as I felt every 
single day.

Our eyes met for just a second, and I could see itâ€”that same loneliness I saw in the 
mirror every morning. Before I could think about it, I nodded toward the empty seat 
across from me. She smiled, a small, grateful smile, and sat down.

We didn't talk much at first. Just the occasional "this pizza sucks" or "do you have 
math next?" kind of stuff. But there was something comforting about not being alone.

The next day, she found me again. And the day after that. We started talking moreâ€”about 
teachers we couldn't stand, shows we both watched, that weird smell in the science lab. 
Little things that made the day feel less heavy.

Then one day in the library, while we were supposed to be studying, she said something 
that changed everything. "You know," she started, her voice barely above a whisper, 
"I was really scared to come to this school. I thought no one would talk to me."

My throat tightened. "I'm glad you sat with me," I said. "I was scared too. Every day."

She looked at me, her eyes getting glassy. "Really? But you always seemed so... 
confident. Like you chose to sit alone."

I almost laughed. "I was just trying to look like it didn't bother me."

We sat there for a moment, just looking at each other, and suddenly it all made sense. 
We were both hiding the same pain. Both pretending we were okay with being invisible.

"Well," she said, wiping her eyes and smiling, "I guess we're not alone anymore."

And for the first time in forever, I actually believed that. Because sometimes, the 
person you need is the one who needs you just as much. And that's when I realizedâ€”
being lonely doesn't mean you're alone. Sometimes you just haven't found your person yet. 
And when you do, everything changes.
```

**Statistics**:

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Script too long

**Problem**: Generated script exceeds 65 seconds
**Solution**: 
- Adjust max_tokens in GPT call
- Post-process to trim to 380 words max
- Use more concise system prompt

### Issue: Poor subtitle alignment

**Problem**: Subtitles not matching audio
**Solution**:
- Check audio quality (no background noise)
- Verify script revision removed problematic punctuation
- Use latest WhisperX model (large-v2 or upgrade to faster-whisper large-v3)

### Issue: Keyframe generation fails (Future)

**Problem**: SDXL generates low-quality or incorrect images
**Solution**:
- Improve shotlist visual prompts with more detail
- Add negative prompts to avoid common issues
- Use SDXL refiner for higher quality
- Increase inference steps (30 â†’ 50)
